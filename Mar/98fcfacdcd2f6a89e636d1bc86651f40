Commercial vehicle provider MAN’s retail operations will on April 1 open a wholly owned operation in Port Elizabeth, which the company considers to be an important location on the Garden Route, to offer support to its clients. MAN says it is the right time to reinforce its footprint by establishing an operation at this location. The new operation will cater for end-of-line pre-delivery inspection checks, which are normally done at the various dealer points around the country. This means that MAN – as an automotive supplier of commercial vehicles – is able to offer ready-to-go solutions from a centralised point, which further enables improved consistency in quality and uniformity of standards. Having a central point in the Eastern Cape also enables the MAN customer to collect their transport solutions from the assembly plant, in alignment with how MAN operates globally. MAN’s ProfiDrive driver training is then provided as a standard service to such collecting customers.
