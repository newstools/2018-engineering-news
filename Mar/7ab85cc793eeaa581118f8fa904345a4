Professor Phakeng who has been widely congratulated on reaching this milestone in her career said she was encouraged by the high level of support she received from different stakeholders during the selection process. “What also stood out about Professor Phakeng was her sound knowledge and understanding of the key challenges and opportunities arising from the changing higher education environment in South Africa and globally,” added the council. Pityana is confident that Phakeng’s leadership will further develop the university and allow it to reach even greater heights.
