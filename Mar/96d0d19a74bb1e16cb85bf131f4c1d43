Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies has congratulated appliance manufacturer Whirlpool South Africa on its R100-million investment in a new manufacturing line that is expected to create about 100 jobs. The investment in the company’s plant, located in the Isithebe Industrial Park near Mandeni, in KwaZulu-Natal, included the procurement of large production equipment that was imported from Europe and India. “This increased and expanded investment reaffirms Whirlpool’s commitment to the country . . . as it retains 1 000 jobs and brings about 100 new jobs . . . I cannot overemphasise the importance of the white goods sector and its contribution to the South African economy in terms of growth, job creation, localisation and exports. All these elements are critically important to the Industrial Policy Action Plan which underpins economic growth,” Davies commented. He added that the investment signifies that South Africa remains an attractive investment destination across all sectors including advanced manufacturing. He further stated that Invest SA, a division of the Department of Trade and Industry, which played a role in facilitating the Whirlpool investment, remains committed to assisting foreign and domestic investors in realising their investment in South Africa. Whirlpool South Africa MD Michele Caputo said that, as the company expands its presence in Southern Africa, it remains committed to providing solutions that will enable growth and sustain economic development. “Whirlpool is keen to support the South African government’s localisation programme by partnering with local manufacturers to consolidate an integrated domestic supply chain,” he added.
