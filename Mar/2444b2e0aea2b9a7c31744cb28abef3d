The Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA) will complete a R10-million upgrade of the Union stadium, in Westbury, this year in a project that the City of Johannesburg reports has already significantly improved the precinct through the knock-on impact of creating jobs and attracting private sector investment. The upgrade, which started during the 2015/16 financial year, entails the design and construction of two new soccer pitches, netball courts, volley ball courts and football courts. The upgrade also includes the removal of illegal dumping around the new grounds and courts. The project employed 10 local labourers and two local small, medium-sized and micro enterprises. The upgrade is also expected to provide opportunities for social interaction and cater for different sporting codes, such as soccer, hockey, cricket, volley ball and aerobics. These sporting codes will contribute to empowering and motivating the youth and others to participate in sport and improve their lifestyle, while staying healthy, states JDA CEO Christo Botes. “Sport and recreation is the hub of community life, especially in Johannesburg regions, such as Westbury, where communities are expected to live, play and work in the area where they live,” he concludes.
