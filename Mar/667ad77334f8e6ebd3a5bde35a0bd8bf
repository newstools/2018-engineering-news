Suzuki Auto South Africa (SASA) saw sales in the domestic market jump by 57% in 2017, to 8 847 units, up from 2016’s 5 631 units. It appears as if the Japanese manufacturer may have another blistering sales year ahead of it, with sales for the first two months of 2018 88% higher than the same period in 2017, at 2 070 units. SASA sales and marketing divisional manager André Venter cites a variety of reasons for Suzuki’s growth, including the 2016 and 2017 brand of the year award from cars.co.za, strong marketing, as well as a growing dealer network – up from 19 dealers in August 2008, to the current 52. Venter says the key to being a successful importer is a favourable exchange rate and reliable product. He adds that the Swift is Suzuki’s best-selling model in South Africa. Pricing for the Swift starts at roughly R156 900. SASA has a number of more affordable vehicles available in a market that has felt the pinch of a recent weak domestic economy. After three years of decline, the South African total new-vehicle market finally managed to inch forward in 2017, growing by 1.8%, to 557 586 units, compared with 2016. Suzuki’s Baleno, Ignis, Swift 1.2, Celerio, Ertiga and Ciaz models are sourced from India, with the Jimny and Grand Vitara sourced from Japan. The Vitara comes from Hungary. The Ignis was in short supply, but this will be remedied soon, says Venter. “Ignis market acceptance was a bit of a surprise. However, we’ve subsequently increased our ordering and we’re back on track.” New model introductions set for 2018 include the Swift in the second quarter, a Ciaz and Celerio facelift, also in the second quarter, and a Vitara facelift in the fourth quarter.
