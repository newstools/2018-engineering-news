Stephan Burger has resigned as CEO of Denel Land Systems (DLS). Burger, who is one of the longest-serving members of the Denel group, was appointed CEO of DLS in 2004. "Under his leadership, DLS achieved remarkable milestones and grew from a R280-million turnover to a R3-billion turnover division. He has been an asset to the growth of the company and it is always a sad moment to lose one of our own," Denel CEO Zwelakhe Ntshepe commented on Tuesday. Denel Maritime CE Ismail Dockrat has been appointed acting CEO of DLS until a permanent successor to Burger is appointed.
