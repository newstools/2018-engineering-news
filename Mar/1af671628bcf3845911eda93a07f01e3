Exchange trading platform 4 Africa Exchange (4AX) on Tuesday listed its first issuer operating in the property sector – Heartwood Properties. Heartwood CEO John Whall said 4AX appealed to the company, owing to the exchange’s listing requirements, which, although strict, suit a small business better than the requirements of some of the larger exchanges. The company has a portfolio of commercial real estate properties primarily in the warehousing and office sector. “This listing encourages a broader participation of shareholders and we look forward to entering the stock market and raising capital on this platform,” Whall enthused. 4AX CEO Advocate Fay Mukaddam said the listing came amid renewed buoyancy in the South African property market, owing to improving business confidence following the inauguration of President Cyril Ramaphosa. She added that 4AX is one of the only two exchange trading platforms in South Africa with a full licence to trade across equity and debt and, “as the only exchange in South Africa and one of the few in the world to own our intellectual property, we want to change the market perception of stock exchanges”. Further, she noted that it is 4AX’s vision to become the preferred alternative exchange for large and small companies in South Africa. The exchange’s structures and listing requirements have been devised so that 4AX is able to accommodate diverse listings and make financial markets more inclusive, while providing a licensed platform for easy access and product variety.
