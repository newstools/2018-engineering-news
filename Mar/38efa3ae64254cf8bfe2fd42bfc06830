Audi has unveiled its e-tron prototype at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, in Switzerland. The prototype offers a preview of the German brand’s first all-electric model. This is also the vehicle that is scheduled for launch in South Africa in 2019 or 2020. The sports-utility vehicle (SUV) has space for five people. The production version of the Audi e-tron prototype can ‘fill up’ at fast-charging stations with up to 150 kW of charging capacity in under 30 minutes. Current planning will see the production version of the Audi e-tron launch in the European market at the end of 2018, when more details about the vehicle will be revealed. The car is produced at a carbon-neutral plant in Brussels, Belgium. In 2020, Audi plans to have three all-electric vehicles in its product range, with a four-door Gran Turismo and a model in the compact segment joining the SUV. Audi plans to launch more than 20 electric cars and plug-in hybrids by 2025, spread across all segments and concepts. Up until the Audi e-tron is officially launched at the end of the year, the SUV will complete test drives on four continents, including Africa, as part of a wide-ranging testing procedure. Audi is testing the pre-series vehicles for customer-focused operation in all climate zones ranging from below –20 ˚C to above 50 ˚C. In addition, intensive tests of the charging technology are being conducted worldwide. In total, just fewer than 250 Audi e-tron prototypes are to be used in the tests. They will cover more than five-million kilometres – roughly equivalent to 125 times around the earth and 85 000 hours on the road.
