JSE-listed Growthpoint Properties has started the excavation process for the 35 000 m2 144 Oxford premium-grade office development in Rosebank, Gauteng, with the project expected to be completed in October 2019. Positioned at the gateway to Rosebank, 144 Oxford will entail two office towers of about 17 500 m2 each. This development is located opposite the landmark Hyatt Regency and is within walking distance of the Rosebank Gautrain station. The building will feature a glass façade across two interlinked towers, each providing exceptional views across the city. Surrounding 144 Oxford are vibrant restaurants, lifestyle, shopping, hospitality and entertainment stores and venues, offered by Rosebank Mall, The Zone @ Rosebank and The Firs. Growthpoint office division asset manager Paul Kollenberg says there is growing demand in the Rosebank node for premium-grade office space, attracting leading businesses. “Demand for space in the well-located Rosebank office hub can be seen in its premium-grade rental levels, which currently surpass those of Sandton and Melrose, both in Gauteng,” he points out. Growthpoint Properties office division director Rudolf Pienaar adds that the company is creating high-performance workspace in a sustainable office building designed for leading businesses that want to position themselves optimally for productivity and staff retention and enjoy a healthy and energising working environment where their business, people and partners can thrive. Growthpoint is targeting a 4-Star Green Star SA rating from the Green Building Council of South Africa for the development.
