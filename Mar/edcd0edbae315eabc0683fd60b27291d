Cape Town International Airport was once again ranked the best in Africa at the Skytrax World Airport Awards held in Stockholm, Sweden, the Western Cape Economic Opportunities Minister Alan Winde said on Thursday. It was the third year in a row Cape Town International won the award. “The fact that these awards are voted for by thousands of travellers who have experienced what Cape Town airport has to offer, makes this award so much more special," Winde said in a statement. “This is proof that travellers are offered a world class service from the moment they set foot off the plane in Cape Town. This is a testament to the hard work of the staff and management at the airport, who work hard every day to ensure travellers are treated with respect and care.” Cape Town International also ranked number 21 of the best 100 airports, globally. Winde said he hoped this would help grow the tourism and hospitality industry in the province.
