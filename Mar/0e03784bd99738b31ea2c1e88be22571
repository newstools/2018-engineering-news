The South African Guild of Motoring Journalists (SAGMJ) on Tuesday evening selected the Porsche Panamera as its 2018 Car of the Year. The Volvo S90 came second, with the Alfa Romeo Giulia in third position. The German manufacturer’s victory is its fourth in six years, with the  Macan S winning the 2015 title, the Cayman S the 2014 title and the Boxster crowned the winner in 2013. The 2018 winner was announced after the ten finalists were put through their paces by a 26-member SAGMJ jury during a two-day test event in January. The finalists were judged on aspects such as affordability; cabin styling layout and ergonomics; the engine; engineering integrity and build quality; exterior design; overall excellence; technology; ride quality; steering and handling; transmission performance and value for money. Last year’s winner was the Opel Astra.
