Heavy equipment manufacturer Bell Equipment has appointed outgoing CEO Gary Bell as nonexecutive chairperson of the board with effect from June 1. Bell, who is one of the sons of the founders of the articulated dump truck manufacturing group, will succeed John Barton, who will become the lead independent nonexecutive director of the board. Commenting on Bell’s appointment, Barton said: “No director will have unfettered powers of decision-making and the responsibility for running the board and the executive responsibility for the business are clearly differentiated. The board has put in place well considered and adequate processes, including the appointment of a lead independent nonexecutive director, to uphold and safeguard adherence to good governance at all times.” Leon Goosen, who was named CEO designate last year, will assume the position of CEO on June 1.
