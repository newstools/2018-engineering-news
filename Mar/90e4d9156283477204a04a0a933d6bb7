The Portfolio Committee on Communications has recommended the removal of Rubben Mohlaloga from the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) council. This follows a request from Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane to start the removal process after the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crime Court, on January 15, convicted Mohlaloga of fraud and money laundering. “The committee took a decision on February 27 to allow Mohlaloga an opportunity to make representations on why he should not be removed, wherein, among other things, he requested to be placed on precautionary leave with full pay, pending the appeal process,” the committee chairperson Humphrey Maxegwana said in a statement on Tuesday. Having reconsidered his representation and having consulted with Parliament’s Constitutional and Legal Services Office, the committee rejected his request.
