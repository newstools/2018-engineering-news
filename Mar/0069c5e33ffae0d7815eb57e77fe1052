State-owned power utility Eskom on Thursday noted that it had received a resignation letter from suspended group executive for information technology Sean Maritz, in which he resigns with immediate effect. Eskom said in a statement on Thursday that the resignation comes against the backdrop of serious charges of alleged misconduct that were levelled against Maritz. A disciplinary hearing, scheduled for March 8 and 9, would no longer be pursued. However, Eskom “reserves its rights to institute legal action in respect of any damages that the company may have suffered arising from his actions at Eskom, and to enforce its legal rights under the Pension Funds Act”. “As indicated during the interim results presentation, a key focus for the new board has been to address governance-related issues as a matter of urgency. The board remains committed to its mandate to root out maladministration as a critical foundation to restoring transparent and effective governance,” the statement said. Before being suspended in January, Maritz had been performing the duties of interim group CEO since October after being “rotated” into the position to replace interim group CEO Johnny Dladla, who has returned to his position as CEO of Eskom Rotek Industries. He had, in turn, replaced acting group CEO Matshela Koko in June. Koko, meanwhile, resigned from Eskom in February. He had been reinstated as the Eskom head of generation, but not acting group CEO, in January.
