Stellenbosch University’s LaunchLab has officially launched the seventh iteration of its Ideas Programme, which calls on startup businesses in multiple industries to validate their business concepts with real market players and start their journey towards the maturity required to attracting customers and obtaining investment. These industries include, but are not limited to, education, smart cities, clean technology, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, safety, blockchain, fintech, insurtech, agritech and food innovations, as well as social enterprises. While the LaunchLab mission is to facilitate valuable connections for startups and corporates, as well as other relevant business partners to help startups excel; the Ideas Programme is aimed primarily at very early-stage businesses looking to validate their concepts or improve their technology offering to their market. LaunchLab further provides access to its client network, which is actively looking for startups to partner with, which aids in the validation process. “The range of industry focus areas this year means that participants will find a place for their innovative business idea, which is a great opportunity to accelerate that business idea towards market readiness,” said LaunchLab CEO Philip Marais. He further explained that the impact of engaging with corporate clients cannot be underestimated. “We find that startups that engage with our clients can accelerate their growth faster than startups following the traditional route to market because the client does not only help provide finance for the startup but [also] access to market,” he said. Submissions for the programme opened on March 19 and will close on May 4. The top ten finalists will be notified by the end of May, after which pitches will be shortlisted and be taken through a process to determine which 10 to 15 businesses will be selected to participate in the LaunchLab incubation programme.
