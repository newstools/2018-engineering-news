Gauteng Premier David Makhura on Wednesday, expressed concern over the proposed property rates increase in the City of Johannesburg following the release of its municipal valuations recently. Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba said that 8 000 property owners will from next week receive Section 78 notices which will revise valuations for properties that appear to be over-valued. These 8 000 valuations, which have been identified as problematic, have experienced considerable increases, many over 100 percent. The City's proposals have been met with an overall outcry by the residents, especially those whose properties have been re-valued by over 100 percent. Angry property owners in the City of Johannesburg have started a petition against the high prices being set on their assets on the councilâ€™s new valuation roll. Makhura said that these rate hikes will put financial strain on the residents who are already buckling under financial pressure due to the weak economic environment. He said that there can be no justification for these increases which will no doubt have a disastrous end for rate payers. "As I said in the the State of the Province Address, life has been tough for many of our residents, the price of food, electricity and transport has been sky-rocketing, placing enormous stress on family finances, these rate increases will negatively affect the real income of families," Makhura said. "I hope the Council is listening to the reactions of the ratepayers and will take their views into consideration when it takes its final decision on the matter." Makhura said that he would be meeting with Mashaba to discuss this further and would appeal to him to ensure that Johannesburg residents are not unduly overburdened with unjustified rate hikes.
