International business aviation company ExecuJet is expanding its managed fleet in Africa with the addition of a Bombardier Challenger 350 to be based in Nairobi, Kenya. The aircraft boasts a capacity of up to ten passengers and an operating range of 3 200 nautical miles. It is capable of flying nonstop from Nairobi to Barcelona, Spain, and has been registered on ExecuJet’s parent company Luxaviation Group’s new San Marino aircraft register, and will be one of the first aircraft operating on the Luxaviation San Marino Air Operating Certificate (AOC). ExecuJet Africa VP Gavin Kiggen states that the company is delighted to bring Bombardier’s premier midsize business jet to its customers in East Africa. “This latest addition underlines the exciting growth in business aviation movements currently being seen in the region.” He adds that ExecuJet is dedicated to supporting this encouraging trend with its expanded fleet. Luxaviation San Marino AOC MD Robert Fisch comments that the San Marino AOC is quickly becoming the go-to option for Luxaviation’s customers worldwide, with aircraft from Europe and the Middle East, and now East Africa, on the aircraft register. “We look forward to introducing many more customers to the industry-leading safety and service standards maintained at our San Marino AOC in the near future.”
