Eastern Cape water board Amatola Water announced on Thursday that it had appointed Vuyo Zitumane as CEO following a recommendation by the Amatola Water Board. Her immediate focus will be to “drive the agency’s demanding turnaround strategy, build and stabilise the water utility and ensure its effectiveness and financial stability”. Zitumane has served as the chairperson on the Eastern Cape development agencies in Joe Gqabi and Buffalo City, as well as having held numerous senior positions in the public sector, notably as the executive director for corporate services with the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality and as the Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Board’s chairperson. She succeeds acting CEO Asanda Gidana, who returns to her role as head of Amatola Water’s operations portfolio. Amatola Water Board chairperson Nokulunga Mnqeta thanked Gidana for her “efforts and inputs, which had helped the water utility through challenging times”. During the past two months, Amatola Water has also appointed Jo Dalbock as its corporate services director, Khotso Maesela as supply chain manager and Siyabulela Fatyi as its information technology manager, which has brought about further stability to the water utility’s leadership team, the utility said in a statement.
