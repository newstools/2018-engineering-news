Global packaging and paper group Mondi has adopted 2050 science-based targets to help limit the rise in global temperature to under 2 ˚C above pre-industrial levels by joining nature conservation organisation, the World Wide Fund for Nature’s (WWF’s) climate leadership programme for businesses – Climate Savers, which aims to transform businesses into low-carbon economy leaders. Mondi is committed to reducing its specific production-related greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions to 0.25 t of carbon dioxide per tonne of saleable product by 2050. The company’s participation in Climate Savers is an extension of a strategic global partnership between Mondi and the WWF that started in 2014, focusing on promoting environmental stewardship in the packaging and paper sector. “In joining Climate Savers, Mondi commits to working towards further reducing GHG emissions across its entire value chain and to taking actions to positively influence the packaging and paper industry, as well as policy-makers,” states Mondi CEO Peter Oswald. He adds that, despite the energy-intensive nature of the packaging and paper industry, Mondi has managed to reduce its GHG emissions by 38% since 2004, by focusing on operational and energy efficiencies by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy, sustainably managing its forests and associated ecosystems and sourcing its raw material responsibly. “Joining the WWF Climate Savers programme reinforces our longstanding commitment to climate change mitigation and demonstrates to industry that using energy efficiently is good for business, while saving the environment.” WWF global climate and energy practice leader Manual Pulgar-Vidal adds that climate change is one of the biggest threats to the world’s future, with fundamental impacts on places, species and people worldwide. “To change things for the better, we need to start acting now.”
