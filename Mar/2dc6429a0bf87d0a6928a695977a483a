Hotel brand Park Inn by Radisson, together with hybrid solar products producer Solarus, have installed a large-scale commercial hybrid photovoltaic and thermal (PVT) project in Cape Town’s central business district – the first PVT project in the city. The project entailed the installation of 30 PowerCollectors – a unique technology that combines the generation of thermal energy with the photovoltaic generation of electricity to produce one of the highest energy yields. “When compared to traditional solar panels, the PowerCollector produces both electricity and hot water output of up to 70 ˚C and delivers three times more energy on the same surface area,” stated Park Inn by Radisson. The installation, located on the hotel’s rooftop, is scheduled to be fully operational by the end of March and will produce an average of 1 050 kWh of energy a week for the hotel. The energy produced – in conjunction with the reduced demand from the grid – will provide electricity and heat throughout the hotel and will save the hotel about €250 000 in heating and energy costs over a 20-year period.
