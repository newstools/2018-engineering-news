South Africa’s power sector has again entered a period of uncertainty after a planned signing ceremony for 27 independent power producers (IPPs) failed to materialise on March 13, following a legal challenge by the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa. The court case, planned for March 27, could resolve the matter for those 27 projects. Nevertheless, investors and stakeholders remain unsure about the way forward for the sector, as well as South Africa’s IPP programmes. Some clarity is likely to be provided at the sixth annual Africa Power Roundtable, which is set to take place on April 10, 2018, at the offices of Webber Wentzel in Sandton Johannesburg and where Energy Minister Jeff Radebe is confirmed to give the keynote address. The conference will also look at developments and opportunities for investment in other parts of the continent. In particular it will delve into opportunities in Botswana, Zambia, Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Ghana. DLO Energy Resources MD and founder of the Africa Power Roundtable Linda Mabhena-Olagunju says the conference, which will be attended by key industry leaders, comes at a critical point for investors in South Africa, where policy clarity is required for further investment in the country’ power sector. “Further it comes at a time where regional integration is at the forefront of government’s strategy on the continent, but the key now is implementation especially around areas such as the proposed gas to power programme,” Mabhena-Olagunju adds. Participants will also hear from Mozambique’s EDM team about opportunities in that country for investment especially in the renewable-energy space. This year, USAID’s Power Africa has also joined in supporting the conference as a strategic partner and deputy coordinator Richard Nelson will be addressing issues around funding for power projects on the African continent.
