Sweet River Trading, which trades as Caffeluxe, has admitted to fixing the prices of coffee capsules to retail customers. The complaint, which was initiated in July 2015, relates to a discount offered by international coffee specialist Global Coffee Export in Checkers stores in 2014, where Caffeluxe threatened not to supply Global Coffee with capsules unless it increased its price to the agreed shelf price. The Competition Commission said on Friday that in terms of an agreement in effect between 2013 and May 2014, Global Coffee was precluded from undercutting Caffeluxe when selling coffee capsules to grocery retail outlets. Caffeluxe has admitted to the contravention and will pay an administrative penalty of R750Â 000 payable in tranches. The commission is not seeking any relief against Global Coffee Export.
