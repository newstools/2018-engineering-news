A water treatment plant built at JSE-listed sea food company Sea Harvest’s internationally accredited Saldanha Bay operations, in the Western Cape, includes reverse osmosis filtration and desalination systems to treat effluent or sea water, and will provide the company with all the water it requires, said Sea Harvest operations director Terence Brown on Thursday at the launch. “The most important deliverable of the plant is 1.15 Mℓ/d of potable water. This will ensure that there is no disruption to our business, that we remain sustainable and profitable and, importantly, protect jobs.” Sea Harvest is the single largest employer within the Saldanha Bay municipality, he added. The quality of the water produced by the plant will meet the drinking water specification of the SANS 241, for minimum requirements for potable water. The quality of the water will be monitored continuously. In addition, the municipality will provide further quality assurance by testing the water to ensure compliance with the required standard. Sea Harvest’s operations are National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications and European Union accredited and, to retain this accreditation, stringent food processing requirements include the use of water, highlighted Brown. The fresh fish processing operations, based at the Saldanha Bay Harbour, are dependent on municipal water to remain operational. Sea Harvest uses municipal water for factory hygiene, primary and secondary fish processing, human consumption, washing bins and tubs, ice and water supply to vessels. “This natural resource is, therefore, a key component of Sea Harvest’s operations,” he said. The process water for Sea Harvest sourced from the municipality had been reduced by 35% between March 2016 and December 2017, and, as a large water user in the municipality, the risks of a loss of water supply, and the associated jobs, prompted the company to build the plant, said Brown.
