Boitumelo Mosako has been appointed CFO of development finance institution the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), effective April 1. Prior to joining the DBSA, she served as the CFO at the South African Bureau of Standards. In 2016, the DBSA formulated and tabled a growth strategy designed to respond to changing client needs, increasing demands to grow developmental impact, persistently difficult economic conditions and an increasingly competitive environment. The need to revise the operating model of the bank was identified as one of the critical enablers to execute the new strategy. The new operating model incorporates three front-line divisions â€“ coverage, transacting and project preparation.
