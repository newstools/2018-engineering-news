South Africa's Imperial Holdings said on Wednesday CEO Mark Lamberti will resign at the end of the month following a court judgement against him involving a remarks he made to an ex-employee at one of its units. Current CEO of the Motus division Osman Arbee will replace Lamberti at the start of May, the company said in a statement. The company's board said in addition to finding that the ex-employee had suffered damages arising from dismissal, Lamberti was found to have impaired the dignity of the ex-employee during a conversation in April 2015. Lamberti apologised over the incident with the employee, the company said.
