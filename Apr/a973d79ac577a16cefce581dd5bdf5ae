Transport Minister Dr Blade Nzimande has appointed a new board of directors for the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA), led by chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama. The board members, who will serve an initial period not exceeding 12 months, also includes Sango Ntsaluba, Louis Wessie, Jenny Schreiner, Nazir Alli, Doris Tshepe and Mashila Matlala. Nzimande on Friday said the board was carefully selected on the basis of the skills and expertise required to run a company of this magnitude. He added that these skill sets include, besides others, technical, corporate governance, legal, finance, risk management and human resources skills. “As the shareholder, I ensured that only people with expertise, experience and integrity serve in these vital positions. I am committed to change the state of paralysis which currently obtains at PRASA and that this must be a thing of the past,” Nzimande said in a statement. The appointment of the new board forms part of the Department of Transport’s (DoT’s) mandate to facilitate and enable reliable, economic, safe, comfortable and accessible transport infrastructure and services to all. Nzimande noted that, as government, the DoT is committed to ensuring that it manages State-owned entities efficiently and, at the same time, meets certain developmental and social objectives. In consultation with, and on the request of the board, Nzimande has also appointed Dr Simo Lushaba as acting PRASA CEO.
