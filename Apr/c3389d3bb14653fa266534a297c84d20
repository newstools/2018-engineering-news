The Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) is seeking to appoint environmental remedial contractors for Phase 1 of its Remediation of Hydrocarbon Impacted Sites in Ogoni project. This project forms part of FGN’s overhead Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation project (Hyprep), which stems from government’s commitment to implement the recommendations of the United Nations Environment Programme. FGN has invited suitably qualified international or Nigerian companies, as well as consortia, with experience in the environmental remediation of soil and/or groundwater in hydrocarbon-polluted sites to tender for the project. The remediation project will involve site delineation of hydrocarbon impacted sites; remediation of hydrocarbon-impacted soil and/or groundwater; management of solid wastes on site and those generated from remediation activities; training of youths in basic techniques in the environmental remediation of hydrocarbon pollution; and weekly reporting of work activities with georeferenced photos. Tender documents are to be submitted by April 16, at the Nosdra building in Rivers state, Nigeria. Applicants with further queries were advised to contact the Hyprep project coordinator by visiting the Nosdra building, or e-mailing hyprep.procurement@hyprep.gov.ng. Queries must be made up to seven days before the submission deadline.
