Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba on Tuesday directed his department to prepare a comprehensive report and strategy that will deal with managing long queues at Home Affairs branches across the country. Gigaba said this was high priority as the department remained committed to delivering high quality services to citizens and other clients. The former Finance Minister, who returned to the Home Affairs portfolio last month, has maintained that he has been inundated with calls from members of the public regarding their time spent at Home Affairs branches for documents such as smart ID cards, passports and certificates. Gigaba appealed to members of the public to be patient as the matter was receiving “undivided attention”. The Minister concluded that the department has made strides in improving service delivery and added that it is determined to optimise the limited resources at its disposal to ensure that the public is served professionally and efficiently.
