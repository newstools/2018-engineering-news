Project management company SNC-Lavalin has been awarded a R3.3-million contract for a detailed engineering package to provide Sasol with an emergency shutdown (ESD) system replacement in Secunda. SNC-Lavalin’s scope of work includes a detailed control and instrumentation and electrical engineering package design for the replacement of the existing obsolete conlog relay technology ESD systems at Sasol Refinery West units 29, 33 and 34, with a new ESD system. This involves the verification of the basic design, detailed engineering for the new ESD system, including factory acceptance testing support, as well as construction support. “This is our first opportunity to execute the detailed design of an ESD system with Sasol in Secunda and gives us an opportunity to showcase our engineering expertise and capabilities, while ensuring that we deliver exceptional service on time and within budget,” GM Stuart Kent said in a statement on Thursday.
