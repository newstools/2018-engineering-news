The Competition Tribunal on Friday confirmed a consent agreement with removal and moving company A&B Movers, which admitted that it had entered into an agreement with other removal companies to charge their customers a R350 e-toll levy when they are required to travel on Gautengâ€™s highways. The Competition Commission initiated a complaint in which it alleged that the eleven companies had held a meeting under the auspices of the Northern Provinces Professional Movers Association of South Africa and allegedly agreed to pass on to customers the additional costs they incur when they transport goods along the Gauteng e-toll roads. As part of the consent agreement, A&B Movers has agreed to assist the Competition Commission with its investigation of the complaint. The company is also liable to pay an administrative penalty of R208 121. Other companies who are under investigation by the commission include Stuttaford Van Lines Gauteng Hub, Pickfords Removals South Africa, Brytons Removals, Amazing Transport, Key Moves, Bayley Worldwide, Selection Cartage, Elliot Mobility, Crown Relocations and Magna Thomson.
