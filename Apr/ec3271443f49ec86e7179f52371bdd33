The Competition Commission has won the Agency of the Year in Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa award at the eighth annual Global Competition Review (GCR) Awards held in Washington DC, in the US. GCR is a world-leading competition law and policy journal and news service that monitors competition enforcement worldwide. The winners are chosen by the international competition community through a nomination and online voting process. The shortlisted nominees included institutions, people and matters considered to be the best of the best in 2017. GCR reported that Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission and Egypt’s Competition Authority were also nominated, but that South Africa’s competition enforcer emerged as the clear winner. The Competition Commission is the best-established antitrust agency in Africa, with a record of cracking down on cartels – big and small – and involvement in some of the world’s biggest deals, said GCR. Competition Commission commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele said the agency is honoured to receive this award. “We look forward to a productive and fruitful year ahead, as we work to effectively contribute towards a growing and inclusive economy for South Africans.”
