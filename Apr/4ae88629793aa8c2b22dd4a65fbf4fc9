State-owned power utility Eskom says it is considering a proposal by Optimum coal mine business rescue practitioners (BRPs) to reduce the monthly coal supply tonnage from the mine from 400 000 t to 200 000 t for the remainder of the contract period. Eskom on Monday stressed, however, that it has not agreed to any price adjustment with the BRPs, as alleged by some newspapers over the weekend. Eskom said that, should it agree to a reduction of the coal supply tonnage from Optimum, such will be done at the current coal supply contract price. Under the terms of its coal supply agreement, Optimum is obliged to supply 400 000 t of coal to Eskom’s Hendrina power station, in Mpumalanga, South Africa, each month at the price of R201.46/t. Meanwhile, Eskom has had discussions with the BRPs with a view to ensuring that they continue to perform, in terms of the coal supply agreement, and that coal supply to the power station is resuscitated without further delays. In addition, the power utility noted that it is not in possession of the business rescue plan, and can confirm that it has requested the plan so that it can engage amicably as an affected party.
