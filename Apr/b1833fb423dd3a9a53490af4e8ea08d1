A larger, purpose-built modern forensic pathology facility is being built at the Groote Schuur Hospital, in the Western Cape, to replace the Forensic Pathology Services Laboratory, in Salt River, and is expected to be completed in mid-2019. The project, headed by the Department of Transport and Public Works, will cost about R281-million. Once complete, the Observatory Forensic Pathology Institute will provide Level 4 forensic services aimed at extracting, analysing and preserving the integrity of evidence for use by the criminal justice system. The facility will include 26 autopsy tables – four dissection suites with six tables each, as well as two teaching and training dissection suites. There will be 360 refrigerated body spaces – 180 admission fridges and 180 dispatch fridges. In addition, the building will be able to accommodate up to 100 visitors to the bereavement centre a day; up to ten waiting undertakers and up to 20 students at a time. The project makes use of labour-intensive methods that provide a number of short-term work opportunities and skills training for local people. To date, R603 800 has been spent on targeted enterprises, R121 400 on targeted suppliers, R100 000 on targeted local labour.
