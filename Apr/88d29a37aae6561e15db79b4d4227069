South Africa will host the Japan–Africa Public Private Economic Forum at the Sandton Convention Centre from May 3 to 4. The forum, organised by the Japanese government and South Africa, follows an announcement made in 2016, in Nairobi, Kenya, by Japanese PM Shinzo Abe where he outlined plans to accelerate the promotion of private sector-led economic growth by encouraging further business encounters among Japanese and African companies. The programme for the two days will include a plenary, thematic sessions, business-to-business meetings and an exhibition to showcase Japanese products, which will open the way to new business frontiers and networking sessions among participants. Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies says the Japan-Africa Public Private Economic Forum will provide an opportunity for Japanese and African companies, as well as key business and development-related institutions, to highlight their work in Africa. “The forum will provide participating countries with opportunities to capitalise on the presence of a range of business actors to reflect on their approach to boosting investment in their respective countries, including by leveraging the necessary public and private resources. “Discussions will focus on the challenges surrounding private-sector-driven economic growth and showcase successful and innovative examples to explore a way forward,” notes Davies.
