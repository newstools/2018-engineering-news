Dual-listed Oando has officially commissioned its new office building, the Wings Office Complex, in Lagos, Nigeria. The complex, which was commissioned by State and Petroleum Minister Ibe Kachickwu, comprises two 12-storey towers with 27 000 m2 of lettable office space, a three-level car park, four high-speed 12-person passenger lifts per tower retail space and a waterfront. It offers an indoor event space that can accommodate up to 300 people, with floor to ceiling windows which provide a scenic view of the waterfront and allows maximum natural daylight. It also has an outdoor waterfront event area with capacity to host 200 people. The office complex is a smart and energy efficient building that regulates its internal temperate to acclimatise with the outdoor temperature. “The idea for the Wings Office Complex was conceived in 2009 and construction started in 2013. The project signifies the end to a series of capital projects that we have pioneered, invested in and built,” CEO Wale Tinubu said in a statement on Thursday. The building also uses energy efficient and smart lighting systems, with occupancy and daylight sensors to ensure office lights are only on when they are needed, specifically when occupants are in a room and sunlight is diminishing.
