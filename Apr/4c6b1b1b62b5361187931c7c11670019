South African Airways (SAA) has maintained a 4-Star Skytrax ranking, in both business and economy class, for a sixteenth consecutive year. “This win will surely strengthen our global position for once again being awarded a 4-Star ranking. Awards [like these] demonstrate that SAA is standing its ground as one of the leading airlines in the world, despite the challenges the company is facing,” SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali said on Tuesday. “We are fortunate to have had our latest addition Airbus A330-300 audited this year among our aircraft fleet,” commented Tlali. The Skytrax 4-Star ranking is a seal of quality approval awarded to airlines that are supplying good-quality performance across a range of product and service-delivery rating areas. Skytrax determined the rating after detailed product and service standards audits for each featured airline and it is not connected to any customer ratings. This rating signifies airlines providing a good standard of product and staff service across all travel categories, including cabin seating, safety standards, cabin cleanliness, comfort amenities, catering, tax-free sales, reading materials, in-flight entertainment and staff service. The 4-Star rating also places SAA among other international and partner airlines. Skytrax commented that SAA operates in a highly competitive environment with other African airlines such as Air Mauritius, Royal Air Maroc, Air Seychelles and Ethiopian Airways, who have also achieved 4-Star ratings.
