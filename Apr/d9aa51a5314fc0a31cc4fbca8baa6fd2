President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Friday that government was committed to accelerating land redistribution, adding that economic freedom means that the land that was taken from black South Africans needs to be returned. "We are committed to accelerate the redistribution of land, both in urban and rural areas, to ensure that poor South Africans are able to own land and have the means to work it. This is a measure that aims to extend property rights to all South Africans," Ramaphosa said.
 
"Among the measures we will use to accelerate redistribution is that of expropriation without compensation where it is necessary and justified. We call on all South Africans to be part of the broad process of consultation on how we should implement this decision in a way that makes redistribution meaningful and which contributes to a stronger economy, greater agricultural production and improved food security." Ramaphosa was speaking at the Freedom Day celebrations in Bloemfontein, Free State.
