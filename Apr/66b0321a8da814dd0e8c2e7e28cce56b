International law firm Pinsent Masons has appointed George Sibanda as head of the firm's Johannesburg office. Sibanda, who joined the firm when it launched its presence in Africa last year, is a highly skilled corporate specialist and has worked on numerous capital raisings, including on the largest ever initial public offering on the JSE. He will be supported by deputy office head Apicksha Patel. Since the opening of its Johannesburg office in February 2017, Pinsent Masons' Africa practice has continued to provide a full spectrum of legal advice to infrastructure and energy clients across the African continent. “Africa is a crucial market for the infrastructure, energy and technology sectors. Our Johannesburg office is a thriving base for our connectivity to the region and has enabled us to scale our service to clients operating within and into all of Africa,” commented Pinsent Masons managing partner John Cleland.
