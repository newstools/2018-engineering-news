Property developer Atterbury has completed the refurbishment of Trumali House, in Stellenbosch, into modern multitenant A-grade offices with 3 500 m2 of space. Atterbury also signed the building’s first tenant, African chicken brand and restaurant chain Hungry Lion, which will begin operating from its new headquarters from May. “The location of Trumali House is ideal for our fast-growing business of more than 200 stores across Southern Africa,” said Hungry Lion quick service restaurant CEO Adrian Basson. He added that as an innovative corporate business, Hungry Lion believed the Stellenbosch energy and talent pool is the perfect cultural fit for its expanding head office. Atterbury Western Cape development manager Gerrit van den Berg said that securing Hungry Lion as a tenant is an excellent starting point from which to build the business community at Trumali House. The occupants will benefit from Trumali House’s convenient location on the corner of the R44 – which runs between Stellenbosch and Somerset West – and Trumali road. The Trumali House tenants will also benefit from the convenience of nearby shopping facilities, including a convenience centre, filling station and a 24-hour Woolworths. The building is well served by public transport and is in good proximity to several of the town’s schools. Additionally, it is directly adjacent to the new Eikestad Mediclinic hospital, which also makes it the ideal address for businesses for medical industry partners. About 2 400 m2 of space remains available to lease at Trumali House, with a generous parking ratio of four bays per 100 m2. Van den Berg noted that negotiations are under way with several prospective clients and that the signing of a second tenant is imminent.
