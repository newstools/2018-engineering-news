The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said on Friday it had awarded two of three gas pipeline contracts which in total will be worth more than $2.8-billion. One contract for a roughly 200 km (124.27 miles) stretch of the 614 km Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano pipeline and stations was awarded to Oando and OilServe, the State oil company said in a statement. Another stretch of about 200 km was given to a partnership between China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau and Brentex, NNPC said. It did not say how much each individual contract was worth. A third contract will be executed in the coming weeks, NNPC said.
