The Youngsters-on-the-Air youth camp, which brings together radio amateurs younger than 26, will be held for the first time in South Africa from August 8 to 15. Eighty young radio amateurs from across Europe, Africa and parts of the Middle East are expected to attend the event, which will enable young radio amateurs to learn new skills and discuss and share ideas about amateur radio and its future. The event, which will be hosted by the South African Radio League (SARL), is held in conjunction with Region one (Africa, Europe and parts of the Middle East) of the International Amateur Radio Union. “This annual event creates, in addition to amateur radio, the opportunity to learn about different nationalities and cultures, foster international friendships and goodwill, as well as learn new radio communication and technical skills,” SARL president Nico van Rensburg commented. He added that during this year’s camp, the event will look at empowering the group of participants to become mentors in their own country and transfer the skills they have learned in South Africa. The week-long programme includes building a radio transceiver kit, becoming involved in launching and tracking of a high-altitude balloon with various on-board radio equipment, honing communication skills using multifrequency amateur radio stations and other technology and communications based activities.
