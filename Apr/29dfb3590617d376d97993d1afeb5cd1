Telecommunications company MTN Group has committed to the creation of 1 000 jobs within the first year of the Youth Employment Service (YES) initiative. President Cyril Ramaphosa last month launched the initiative – a business-led collaboration with government and labour which aims to empower one-million young South Africans by offering paid quality work opportunities over the next few years. MTN plans to create the committed 1 000 jobs across its South African business and its group head office, covering both operational and functional roles. “YES is an innovative social partnership that has the potential to be a significant catalyst for economic growth and development,” says MTN Group president and CEO Rob Shuter.
