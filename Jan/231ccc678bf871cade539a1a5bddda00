Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) has called for the resignation of State-owned Eskom generation group executive Matshela Koko. This follows the “welcomed” resignations of CFO Anoj Singh and acting group capital head Prish Govender. “BLSA reiterates its position that Koko’s reinstatement was ill-conceived and premature and should never have happened. This position is borne out by new disclosures that he breached the conditions of his suspension,” said BLSA communications director Themba Maseko in a note published Wednesday. “His continued presence at Eskom is undesirable, untenable and will compromise investigations and undermine the new leadership,” he said, adding that Koko needed to step down on Wednesday ahead of – or soon after – his appearance at the Parliamentary Inquiry into Governance Failures at Eskom. Meanwhile, BLSA supported and had full confidence in the new Eskom board, and welcomed a directive from the Presidency stating that the board was directed to immediately remove all Eskom executives, including Koko and Singh, who were facing allegations of serious corruption and other acts of impropriety.
