	The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has started the R37-million reconstruction of the Bridge road bridge over Klipspruit river, in Soweto, owing to overtopping during heavy rainfall. 
	“[The] bridge in Klipspruit West is known to bring traffic to a halt during heavy downpours, rendering it unsafe for pedestrians to cross owing to increased water levels on low lying areas of the structure,” JRA said in a statement on Friday.
	 
	The 12-month reconstruction of the vehicular and pedestrian bridge began on January 8 and is expected to reach completion in early January 2019.  
	As part of the construction process, Bridge road will be closed to the public throughout the construction period, from January 1 to December 31. 
	A traffic management plan has been put in place and motorists are advised to consider alternative routes during the construction period. 
	Access will be limited to property owners and pedestrians. Temporary warning signs have been installed and the road will be barricaded off and traffic will be redirected via Main road.
	 
	“Owing to the presence of construction vehicles in the vicinity, motorists are requested to adhere to the traffic advisory and use the detour route via Main road.”
	 
	Property owners who will be allowed access are required to travel at a safe distance upon entry into the construction area, travel at reduced speeds, be aware of construction workers on site and adhere to traffic guidelines, flag people and signage.
