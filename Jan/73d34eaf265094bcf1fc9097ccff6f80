	A partnership between South African oil and gas company Engen and logistics group DSV Global Transport and Logistics, which has seen the placement of automated parcel lockers, known as DSV ByBoxes, at Engen service stations since 2014, has reached its 20 000 parcel mark. 
	There are currently 65 DSV Intelligent ByBox lockers at Engen service stations across South Africa. 
	Engen retail GM Seelan Naidoo said the trend towards buy and collect has gained momentum. 
	“Our partnership with DSV ByBox is another way in which we can offer our customers real convenience and take full advantage of this growing trend. Our footprint around the country, as well as our ambitious plans for the year ahead, will position our partnership as a leading buy and collect service provider. 
	DSV ByBox offers the public a secure and convenient means to send or receive parcels. 
	DSV MD Greg Saffy explains that, when ordering online, shoppers can select the ByBox delivery option to their nearest locker at selected Engen service stations. 
	Parcels are then dispatched the next day and drivers scan them in at the selected ByBox terminal. The correct one opens automatically and an SMS is sent to the customer with the delivery location and a PIN number to access the locker. 
	Customers can also send parcels from Engen service stations through the DSV ByBox by buying a DSV PAK from an associated retailer, packaging the parcel, completing the dispatch note, scanning the parcel in at a ByBox terminal and following the touch screen instructions to put it in the designated locker.
	
	“Engen is excited to be a part of this innovative journey,” added Naidoo.  
	“Together with DSV we are bringing an alternative, user-friendly delivery solution to the South African market. Engen is all about convenient solutions and this service is another way that we are trying to make life better for our customers.”
