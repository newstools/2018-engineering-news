	As artificial intelligence (AI) development continues on a path of exponential growth, a new research report by Gartner indicates that, by 2022, personal devices will know more about an individual's emotional state “than his or her own family”. 
	The ‘Predicts 2018: personal devices’ report notes that “emotion AI systems” and affective computing were allowing everyday objects to detect, analyse, process and respond to people's emotional states and moods to provide better context and a more personalised experience. 
	“Beyond smartphones and connected home devices, wearables and connected vehicles will collect, analyse and process users' emotional data through computer vision, audio or sensors that capture behavioural data to adapt or respond to a user's wants and needs,” explained Gartner research director Roberta Cozza. 
	The insight emerges as Gartner predicts that, by 2021, 10% of wearables users will have changed lifestyles and behaviours, and thereby extend their life spans by an average of six months. 
	“As AI emotion systems evolve, there is huge potential for specialised devices, such as medical wristbands, which can anticipate life-threatening conditions and facilitate an early response system,” said Gartner research VP Annette Zimmermann. 
	Further, special apps are also being developed for diagnostic and therapy services that will help to recognise conditions such as depression or help children with autism.
