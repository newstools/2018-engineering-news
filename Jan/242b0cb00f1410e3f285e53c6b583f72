	The Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) has opened a request for proposals to receive comprehensive business plans and project proposals from start-up or emerging waste management and recycling companies requiring development or support from the department’s recycling enterprises support programme (RESP). 
	Launched by Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa, the RESP aims to support the establishment of at least two recycling companies, owned by historically disadvantaged individuals, in each province, through grants of up to R5-million per project. 
	Through the RESP, these companies will significantly contribute to the diversion of waste from landfill while creating jobs and economic prosperity, increasing recycling rates and promoting innovation. 
	Bids can be obtained from the DEA’s Environment House, in Pretoria, where a compulsory briefing session will be held for interested parties on January 17 at 11:00. 
	Applicants are required to be at least 51% black-owned.
