The rand strengthened against the dollar on Wednesday, breaching the 12.00 level for the first time since 2015 as the market remains euphoric after deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa's election in December to lead the ruling ANC party. By around 1150 am the rand was trading at 11.95 against the US currency.
