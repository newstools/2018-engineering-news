South African Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Daniel Mminele has been bestowed the Great Order of Merit by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier for his work in furthering German-South African relations. German Ambassador Martin Schäfer is to hand over Germany's highest tribute to Mminele on Tuesday. "With this award, our President acknowledges the outstanding contribution Deputy Governor Mminele has made to improving and furthering the relations between our two nations," Schäfer said. "Through his activities and commitments he has showcased the values that South Africa and Germany share: Deputy Governor Mminele is a believer in the merits of international cooperation and globalisation which is inclusive and responsive to the needs of all."
	
	Instituted in 1951, the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany is the highest tribute that Germany can pay to individuals for services to the nation. It is awarded for achievements in the political, economic, social or intellectual realm and for all kinds of outstanding services to the nation in the field of social, charitable or philanthropic work. Mminele said he was humbled and honoured to receive this award from the German President. "It will serve as a source of inspiration and encouragement to continue to work with colleagues in both Germany and South Africa to enhance the already strong relationship between our countries, and to promote the objectives we share for international financial and economic coordination and cooperation," Mminele said. Mminele, who went to school in Hamm, Germany, had a highly successful career at the Westdeutsche Landesbank in Düsseldorf. From 2003 to 2010, he also served as a member of the board of the Deutsche Internationale Schule Johannesburg, including as deputy chairperson, thus dedicating himself to promoting the collaboration between young people from both countries.
