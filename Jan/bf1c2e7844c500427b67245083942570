The ingredients that allow for inclusive growth to take place are already lined up, but it will be up to the private sector, governments and civil society to start the dialogue and determine the degree of intention to take growth to the next level. The pursuit of inclusive growth needed to be taken seriously, as, aside from a financial economic worth of $7-trillion, it promoted participation, equality, growth and stability in the world, said Mastercard Middle East and Africa president Raghu Malhotra on Thursday. “If we do not do something [to enable inclusive growth], business will not succeed in a failing world,” he told delegates at the Deloitte Africa in 2018 Outlook Conference. In the wave of globalisation, there are the haves and the have-nots, and “somewhere down the line”, over the last 15 years, the realisation has emerged that the creation of a stable world can not be created without inclusivity. The world is already paying the costs of poverty, significant inequality, protests, riots and subpar healthcare, besides others, and an exit from this cycle will require a focus on inclusive growth. “We need to make it a part of our everyday thinking,” he said. Malhotra set out four pillars needed to set the world on a path of inclusive growth – awareness and understanding while holding dialogues; policy, regulation and the involvement of government; technology as an enabler; and partnerships sharing access and knowledge, along with mainstreaming strategies. “Do we set our aim too low sometimes when it comes to inclusive growth?” he asked, noting that inclusive growth needed to challenge the norm. He also questioned how intent the world really was on driving inclusive growth to a new level.
