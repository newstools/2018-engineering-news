The US Mission to South Africa and the National Research Foundation on Thursday opened applications for the Fulbright Foreign Student Program for 2019-2020. The Fulbright Program hopes to attract students interested in pursuing a Master’s or Doctoral degree at any accredited institution in the US. The world-renowned programme offers scholarships that cover up to the full cost of tuition and living expenses in the US for South African students. It is the US government’s flagship international educational exchange programme and was established in 1946 to increase mutual understanding between the people of the US and more than 150 countries, including South Africa. US Chargé d’Affaires Jessye Lapenn said the Fulbright Program attracted the brightest academic talent from around the world. “I encourage South Africans who are dedicated to leadership, collaboration and innovation in their fields to apply. This can be a life-changing experience that will have a profound influence on your professional and personal endeavours for years to come. The United States welcomes you,” she said. Applications close April 22, 2018, but applicants are encouraged to start the application process as soon as possible. 
	South African students wishing to pursue a Master’s degree must have completed a four-year B-Tech degree or a three-year Bachelor’s degree with an Honors degree. Prospective Doctoral students must have successfully obtained a Master’s degree.
