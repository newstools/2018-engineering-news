The construction of Transnet National Ports Authority’s (TNPA’s) new plough tug has kicked off in Port Elizabeth. The yet-to-be-named vessel, which is expected to be handed over to TNPA Dredging Services by October this year, will be used as a bed leveller, smoothing out high spots created by marine traffic in high-volume berth areas. The new vessel is being designed, manufactured, assembled, commissioned and delivered by black woman-owned shipbuilder Tide Marine Shipyard, which was awarded the contract in October 2016, with initial work starting in September 2017. “The new vessel is the first of its kind to be built for TNPA in South Africa,” said TNPA infrastructure and port planning GM Hamilton Nxumalo. In an added advantage over the vessel being replaced, the new tug boasted the latest global technology and will be able to sail from port to port. In the next few months, the plough tug will be relocated from the contractor’s workshop to the Port Elizabeth port’s recently upgraded 40 t slipway and boat hoist in the Yacht Club precinct, where its accommodation and final fittings will be added. “The plough tug is the latest acquisition in TNPA Dredging Services’ R2-billion-plus fleet renewal programme, which has already seen the delivery of some of the continent’s most powerful dredging vessels in recent years,” said TNPA Dredging Services executive manager Carl Gabriel. The 200 t of steel to be used in the construction of the tug will be sourced in South Africa. Up to 30 jobs will be created in technical fields such as engineering, boilermaking and welding. “We will also be upskilling local marine engineering students with on-site experience so that learnings from this project can continue to serve the industry long after completion,” added Tide Marine Shipyard GM Fabian Crocker. Naval architecture firm Naval Africa will provide technical expertise and quality assurance on the project to support the shipbuilder.
