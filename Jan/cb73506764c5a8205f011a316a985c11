	The Toyota Hilux in 2017 again took the crown in the annual brawl for the top spot on the bakkie sales charts. 
	Becoming more of a heavyweight bout in recent years, as Ford stepped up its game in this lucrative segment of the local market, Toyota South Africa Motors (TSAM) sold 36 422 Hilux bakkies in 2017, compared with Ford Ranger sales of 32 811 units. 
	Ford, however, did manage much higher Ranger export numbers than that of the Hilux. Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa exported 57 311 Rangers in 2017, compared with TSAM’s 40 990 Hilux bakkies. 
	Bakkies again proved to be South Africa’s favourite vehicle, with the Volkswagen Polo Vivo the best-selling passenger car in 2017 at 28 402 units, followed by the Volkswagen Polo, at 22 916 units. 
	Volkswagen Group South Africa (VWSA) will introduce the new Polo and Polo Vivo to the local market in the first quarter of this year. Both these vehicles will be produced in South Africa, at VWSA’s Uitenhage plant, in the Eastern Cape, as is the case with the current models. 
	The Ranger and Hilux bakkies are also assembled in South Africa. 
	Last year proved to be a mixed bag for the market catering to those with a few more zeros in their bank accounts. 
	Bentley sales increased from 41 units in 2016 to 59 units in 2017. 
	Porsche sales, however, declined from 1 430 units in 2016, to 1 301 units in 2017. 
	Ferrari also saw sales decline, dropping from 94 units in 2016, to 76 units in 2017. 
	Maserati had a positive year, increasing sales from 113 units in 2016, to 165 units last year. 
	Ford Mustang sales increased from 860 units in 2016, to 898 units in 2017. 
	Overall new-vehicle sales in South Africa improved by 1.8% in 2017 compared with 2016.
