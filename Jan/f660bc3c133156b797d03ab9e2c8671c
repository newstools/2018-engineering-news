	The Africa Energy Indaba (AEI) has entered into a strategic partnership with the South African Electrotechnical Export Council (SAEEC) to grow and develop the African energy sector with SAEEC member companies.
	 
	The SAEEC is a public–private partnership between South African business and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and was established to facilitate the export growth and internationalisation of its members. 
	The partnership creates an opportunity for the SAEEC to be recognised as the trade association partner of the AEI 2018 being held in Johannesburg, in February. 
	“We are delighted to partner with the Africa Energy Indaba, an event that is produced by Africans for the benefit of the African energy sector. The value for our member companies participating at [AEI 2018] is measurable and the aim is to link SAEEC members companies to other African businesses, projects or utilities attending the event to conduct business in the energy sector,” SAEEC CEO Chiboni Evans said in a statement.
	 
	At AEI 2018, the SAEEC will profile companies drawn from its membership base that represent South African companies that are highly regarded as solutions providers for power and telecommunications infrastructure projects in Africa. 
	As part of the partnership, the SAEEC, with the support of the DTI, will also be hosting delegates from various African countries, including Zambia, Kenya, Sudan, Mozambique and Tanzania at AEI 2018.
