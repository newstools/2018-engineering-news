	Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has conceded that more still needs to be done to improve the level of education in South Africa despite a number of gains in the last few years. 
	This comes as Motshekga announced that the National Senior Certificate (NSC) Examination pass rate in 2017, with the progressed learners included, stands at 75.1%, a 2.6% improvement from the 72.5% achieved in 2016.  
	The Class of 2017 is the tenth group of learners to sit for the NSCe, and the fourth to write CAPS-aligned NSC examinations.  
	“We will be the first to concede that despite the notable stability of and improvements in our system, we are yet to cross our own Rubicon. We must agree that much has been achieved, but much more needs to be done in the areas of efficiency and quality,” Motshekga said. 
	“We call upon all South Africans to work together with us to move the public schooling to greater heights.” 
	Motshekga said she was taking off her hat to the Class of 2017, and wished them the best for the future. 
	She thanked all the stakeholders involved in the education sector, including the teachers and the parents, for dedicating their time to ensure that learners get the best education possible. 
	“In celebrating the Class of 2017, I must also thank the principals, teachers, and parents for the work they continue to do. What you do at the school level, is what matters the most,” Motshekga said.  
	“The nation had put the future of our learners in your hands, and you delivered. We applaud you for the great work you continue to do on a daily basis.” 
	Umalusi, the Council for Quality Assurance in General and Further Education and Training,  declared the 2017 NSC examinations as “fair, valid and credible”, and “largely incident free” with a few minor disruptions in some parts of the country.
