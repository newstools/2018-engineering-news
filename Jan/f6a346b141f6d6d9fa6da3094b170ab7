Kenyan startup SolarFreeze, which has developed an offgrid solar-powered refrigeration solution for smallholder farmers and traders, has been named the winner of the Africa Energy Prize. The award is a joint initiative between energy multinational Enel and Swiss-based Seedstars World, which facilitates startup competitions in more that 80 countries. The solution is described as a mobile, post-harvest cold store, which enables farmers to store temperature-sensitive produce without having to invest in the creation of storage space. SolarFreeze will enter a three-month programme worth about $50 000 in acceleration services and cash funded by Seedstars. Enelâ€™s collaboration with Seedstars began in July 2017 when the two entities signed a cooperation agreement to stimulate and support the development of innovative energy solutions focused on electric mobility, storage, distributed generation and energy efficiency.
