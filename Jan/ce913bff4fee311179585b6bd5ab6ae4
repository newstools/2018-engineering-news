	US government agency Overseas Private Investment Corporation (Opic) VP David Bohigian met with Togolese Prime Minister Komi Klassou on Wednesday to tour the Opic-supported Lomé thermal power plant, which has tripled the country's energy supply.
	 
	US-based ContourGlobal built the plant in Togo with financing and political risk insurance from Opic. 
	One of the largest investments ever made in Togo, the power plant has succeeded in bolstering the country's energy generation capacity and significantly reducing rolling blackouts.
	 
	"With a growing economy and need for investment in power, infrastructure, water, agriculture and other development sectors, Opic looks forward to growing our partnership with Togo and spurring investment," Bohigian said. 
	Bohigian will travel to Cameroon next where he will visit the Magrabi ICO Cameroon Eye Institute, which is providing comprehensive, high-quality and affordable eye care procedures, with the support of Opic.
	 
	As part of his National Security Strategy, US President Donald Trump last month highlighted the need for a modernised approach by the US government to development finance to help promote economic relationships and increase investment in regions important to American interests.
