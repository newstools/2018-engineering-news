	Electricity solutions provider Aggreko has started to supply stable power in Madagascar, using 28 MW of its heavy fuel oil- (HFO-) generated energy from its Noor 2 turbine, running alongside its joint venture partner Jovena’s Noor 1 turbines. 
	This forms part of an extension to a 50 MW agreement with the country’s national utility company, Jirama. 
	The HFO energy generation solution comprises containerised mobile, modular energy generators that can be configured and deployed in weeks. 
	Aggreko’s HFO offering has lowered the total cost of energy for energy company Jovena and has brought cost effective, reliable and uninterrupted electricity to the 1.4-million residents of the island’s capital, Antananarivo. 
	Aggreko Africa MD James Shepherd pointed out that the company had been active in Madagascar for a number of years. “Installing this new HFO plant was a natural extension to our existing site.
	
	“We know that providing stable and reliable power enables people, communities and businesses to thrive. It is an exciting time for us, Jovena and the entire island of Madagascar, and we are delighted to be here today to officially celebrate our partnership,” he highlighted.
