Dairy products manufacturer Clover has appointed Dr James Wellwood (Whitey) Basson and Flemming Morgan as independent nonexecutive directors. In addition, CFO Frantz Scheepers will also assume his role as an executive director on the Clover board.
	 
	“The balance of Dr Basson’s 45 years’ African retail experience, combined with Morgan’s experience at some of the world’s best-known [fast-moving consumer goods] companies will significantly strengthen the Clover board,” noted chairperson Werner Büchner in a statement released Monday.
	 
	Following these appointments, the Clover board will comprise two executive directors and seven nonexecutive directors, five of whom are independent.
