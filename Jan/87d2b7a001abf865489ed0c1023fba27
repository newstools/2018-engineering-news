	The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has invited black industrialists to apply for participation in a trade mission to Mozambique from March 5 to 9.
	
	The mission forms part of the implementation of government’s Black Industrialists Programme (BIP), which is aimed at promoting industrialisation, sustainable economic growth and transformation through the financial and nonfinancial support of black-owned entities in the manufacturing sector. 
	Anchored on three fundamental pillars, namely access to capital, access to markets and nonfinancial support, the BIP seeks to support companies in agroprocessing, economic infrastructure and energy on the mission. 
	Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies noted that the mission also formed part of the DTI’s strategy to increase trade between South Africa and Mozambique.
	
	“This is an ideal platform for the industrialists who would like to export value-added products and services. I am encouraging the industrialists to take part in this mission and go form partnerships with their Mozambican counterparts for the exploitation of business opportunities in the Mozambican economy,” he added.
	
	Further, Davies highlighted that South Africa had become the main trading partner to Mozambique, with growing bilateral trade of more than R42-billion in 2016.
	
	Participating companies would be funded and screened according to the black industrialists guidelines.
