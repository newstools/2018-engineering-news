South African State-run power utility Eskom said on Tuesday interim profits were down 34% to R6-billion ($504-million) on the back of declining sales and higher finance costs. Eskom, which has been embroiled in a governance crisis and allegations of undue influence in awarding tenders, said in a statement it would address governance concerns and stabilise the firm through its new board.
