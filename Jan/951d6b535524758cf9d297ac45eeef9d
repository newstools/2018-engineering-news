JSE-listed MTN expects to report an improvement of at least 20% year-on-year for headline earnings per share (HEPS) and earnings per share (EPS) for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017. The telecommunications group reported a 77c headline loss a share and a 144c attributable loss a share in 2016, as a result of a $1.1-billion regulatory fine in Nigeria and losses from its 51% interest in Nigeria Tower Interco. The group noted that both HEPS and EPS are likely to be positive. MTN will release its results on March 8.
