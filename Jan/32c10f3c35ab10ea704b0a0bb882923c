The Competition Tribunal has conditionally approved a merger between Gutsche Family Investments, which controls Woodlands Dairy, and Fairfield Dairy. The companies manufacture and supply butter, cheese, cream, flavoured milk, Amasi and raw milk nationally.
	 
	The merging parties intend for the transaction to be implemented in tranches spaced out over a number of years. The Competition Commission, accordingly, recommended that the merger be approved provided that, if the merged entity elects to effect the second tranche of its transaction after two years of the date of the commission’s approval, the merged entity will be required to notify that second tranche as a merger to the commission.
