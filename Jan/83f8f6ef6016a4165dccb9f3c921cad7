State-owned passenger rail service Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) and the United National Transport Union (UNTU) are in advanced stages of discussions to have the suspended Central Line, in Cape Town, reopened on Wednesday. The line was closed on January 10 for safety reasons following the fatal shooting of a security guard at the Khayelitsha station. “PRASA and UNTU are also experiencing the negative impact of crime against the employees and members of UNTU as a result of criminal attacks and the lack of respect for the hard work and sacrifices made in delivering the service,” said PRASA Rail acting CEO Mthuthuzeli Swartz on Tuesday. However, sensitive to the impact of the current termination of service on commuters, Swartz and UNTU group CEO Cromet Melopo are at an advanced stage of talks to ensure the restoration of the Central Line service. “PRASA is appreciative of the willingness of UNTU to find a workable solution to return the service even in the face of rampant attacks against its asset and, most importantly, to its passengers and employees,” Swartz commented. The talks will take place regionwide, with assessments done in a multi-party approach over a two-day workshop planned for January 17 and 18 in Cape Town.
