Eskom's acting head of group capital Prish Govender resigned on Tuesday, South Africa's power utility said. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe first Tweeted, and later confirmed the news on the phone that Govender had left the embattled power utility with immediate effect. "Alert: Eskom's acting head of group capital, Mr Prish Govender, tendered his resignation today. He resigned with immediate effect," Phasiwe Tweeted. "People resigns for various reasons and he just said he wanted to leave. The CEO Phakamani Hadebe has accepted his resignation. You would remember that Govender was reinstated in December last year, but he has decided to leave to pursue other interests," Phasiwe said. Govender was cleared by an investigating which found that there was nothing untoward he had done on his part in the McKinsey/Trillian matter. He had been suspended for allegations of impropriety after Eskom illegally paid R1.6-billion to the advisory firms without any existing contract and derived no benefit from them. Govender's resignation follows that of controversial former Eskom chief financial officer, Anoj Singh, who tendered his resignation on Monday night on the eve of his appearance before the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises.
