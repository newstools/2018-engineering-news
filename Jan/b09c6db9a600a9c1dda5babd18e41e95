JSE-listed electronics and electrical engineering company Reunert has moved to acquire wireless broadband service provider SkyWire Technologies in an effort to expand its information and communications technology (ICT) portfolio. This acquisition complements the ICT segment’s expansion strategy to increase its traditional suite of products and services to include broadband connectivity, and leverages Nashua and ECN brands and market positions to open a wider network for the rapid deployment of high-quality broadband connection. “Adding SkyWire to the communications cluster of the business provides an excellent overlap with Nashua and ECN’s distribution network of 37 franchises and 320 dealers,” said Reunert CEO Alan Dickson. Further, SkyWire’s existing customer base and products will allow Reunert to enter the fixed wireless broadband market as a significant player. SkyWire also has expansion plans into other African territories under way. The SkyWire business, brand and channel will remain as an independent business unit within the communications cluster of Reunert’s ICT segment and SkyWire founding members Mondi Hattingh and Jaco Visagie will stay on at the business. Reunert aims to conclude the transaction, which remains subject to final conditions precedent and the necessary regulatory approvals, by the end of February.
