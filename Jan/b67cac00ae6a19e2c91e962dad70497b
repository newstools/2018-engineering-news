	The price of fuel products will drop with effect from midnight on Tuesday, according to the energy department. 
	Petrol 93 octane ULP (unleaded) and LRP (lead replacement) will drop by 29 cents a litre (c/ℓ), petrol 95 ULP and LRP by 34 c/ℓ, diesel 0.05 percent sulphur by 22 c/ℓ, and diesel 0.005 percent sulphur by 26 c/ℓ, the department said in a statement. 
	The wholesale price of illuminating paraffin will decrease by 28 c/ℓ and the single maximum national retail price by 37 c/ℓ. The maximum retail price for LPGas will drop by 71 cents a kilogram. 
	While the average international product prices of petrol, diesel, and illuminating paraffin had increased last month, the rand had appreciated against the US dollar. This had led to a lower contribution to the basic fuels price on petrol, diesel, and illuminating paraffin, the department said.
