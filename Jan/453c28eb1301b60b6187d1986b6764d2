Illovo Sugar South Africa has appointed Mamongae Mahlare MD, effective March 1. She will succeed Dave Howells who stepped down to focus on his role as corporate and external affairs executive within the broader Illovo Sugar Africa Group.
	 
	Mahlare previously held commercial, operational and engineering roles at SABMiller, Tanzania Breweries, Unilever and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. 
	 
	“I am particularly excited to announce the appointment of Mahlare as MD of our South African business. She joins Rebecca Katowa at Zambia Sugar as the group’s second female country MD and is, I believe, the first woman MD of a sugar producer in South Africa – a long overdue step forward in closing the gender gap in our industry,” group MD Gavin Dalgleish said in a statement on Wednesday.
