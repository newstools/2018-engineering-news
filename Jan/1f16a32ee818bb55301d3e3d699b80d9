Deloitte’s yearly ‘Technology, Media and Telecommunications (TMT) Predictions’ report has forecast major strides in machine learning for enterprises this year. The report predicts a doubling of the number of enterprise machine learning pilots and deployments this year and, subsequently, the use of machine learning technology, underpinned by new chips and better software tools. “We have reached the tipping point where adoption of machine learning in the enterprise is poised to accelerate,” said Deloitte Global Media and Entertainment and TMT Africa Leader Mark Casey. Easier, cheaper and faster elements will start moulding the more intensive use of machine learning in the enterprise, with growth emerging from new semiconductor chips that enable applications to use less power and become more responsive, flexible and capable. The TMT Predictions report also highlighted the growth of smartphone adoption, with more than 90% of adults in developed countries expected to own a smartphone by 2023, as well as the rising trend in mobile-only wireless home Internet. Deloitte Global further predicted that live broadcast and events would generate over $545-billion in direct revenues this year, while traditional television viewing by 18- to 24-year-olds would decline by 5% to 15% a year in the US, Canada and the UK in 2018 and 2019.
