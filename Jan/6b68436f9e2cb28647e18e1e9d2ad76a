	Private higher education institution Monash South Africa (MSA) is extending its academic offering this year by offering engineering within its expanded faculty of business, engineering and technology.
	 
	MSA is the first private higher education institution to offer a Bachelor of Engineering programme that is reviewed by the Engineering Council of South Africa.
	 
	“The shortage of skilled engineers has a widespread effect on South Africa, affecting the country’s functioning in the globalised business environment and economy. Upon graduating with this degree, a student’s skills will be in high demand,” MSA executive Dean Yashin Brijmohan said in a statement released on Thursday.
	 
	The first intake into the greater engineering faculty will be in February and all classes that form part of the Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical and Electronic Engineering programme will be conducted at MSA’s campus, in Ruimsig, Centurion. 
	This will be a full-time programme of a minimum of four years in the mainstream programme and a minimum of five years in the extended programme, giving graduates a National Qualifications Framework Level 8 qualification.
