Seafood processing company Sea Harvest on Monday said it expects to report basic earnings per share (EPS) of between 110c and 124c for the year ended December 31, paired with headline earnings per share (HEPS) of between 99c and 113c apiece. This will be the company's maiden full-year results since listing on the JSE in March last year. The figures were compared with the EPS of 86c and HEPS of 57c for 2016, which Sea Harvest released in a prelisting statement. The improvement was driven by the South African operations, with strong market demand for Cape Hake globally and a significantly enhanced performance from the investments made in the Saldanha Bay processing plants. Sea Harvest will release its result on March 6.
