Phase 2 of petrochemicals company Sasol’s Fischer-Tropsch Wax Expansion Plant (FTWEP) has successfully been commissioned at its Sasolburg operation. Valued at R13.6-billion, the plant has successfully started in its entirety and has been running stably for six months. The project is aimed at expanding Sasol’s Southern African operations as part of the company’s regional strategy, while demonstrating the company’s commitment to South Africa through industrial investment, said Sasol chemicals business executive VP Fleetwood Grobler. “With completion of this project, South Africa is now one of the leading countries of wax production globally,” Sasol joint president and CEO Bongani Nqwababa said at the inauguration event on Tuesday. He added that the plant would be able to produce up to 137 000 t/y of wax within two years. Marketed through Sasol Performance Chemicals, the FTWEP will produce hard waxes, medium waxes, liquid paraffin and waxy oils for use in various industrial applications, including hot-melt adhesives, polyvinyl chloride processing, inks, paints, coatings and asphalt applications. A total of 49 service providers and about 5 500 construction workers were employed during the duration of the project. About 37-million hours were worked. The FTWEP is one of a number of major capital investments the company has made in South Africa. Sasol joint president and CEO Stephen Cornell, Free State Department of Economic, Small Business Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs MEC Benny Malakoane and Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu’s adviser Tami Mazwai were also in attendance at Tuesday’s inauguration.
