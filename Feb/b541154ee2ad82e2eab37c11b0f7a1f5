Digital industrial company GE and flexible energy storage systems operator Arenko Group have entered into a strategic alliance to build grid-scale energy storage systems in the UK.
	
	The companies will seek to leverage the advantages of combining GE's battery technology solutions, power electronics and advanced controls with Arenko's leadership in operating batteries in the UK market and its proprietary energy trading software platform. GE Power global commercial and marketing executive Mirko Mollnari stated that energy storage would help balance supply and demand close to real time, avoiding frequency drifts and supporting the mid-term response to grid imbalances. "The flexibility it offers smooths the fluctuating nature of renewable energy, provides quick reserves when needed, stores excess energy generation and much more. Energy storage will enable a more efficient system for a more reliable supply of electricity to consumers," he added.
