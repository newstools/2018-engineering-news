JSE-listed Allied Electronics (Altron) subsidiary Altech Radio has been awarded a three-year, R585-million contract to establish an affordable, secure, open-access broadband network in Limpopo. Phase one of the Limpopo provincial government-led project, implemented through Limpopo Connexion, will see Altech Radio deploy information and communication technology (ICT) connectivity across government departments, municipalities, businesses and households in the province. It will also provide a network operation, control centre and data centre for the project, which is aligned to the national broadband policy, South Africa Connect. “The Limpopo government aims to empower community members to participate in an inclusive information society and mainstream economy,” said Limpopo Connexion acting CEO Baldwin Ramasobane in a statement on Friday. The Limpopo broadband network would reduce the cost of doing business for government, industry and civil society and was a prerequisite for effective e-service implementation in the province, he added. “Altech Radio hopes to play an important role in transforming Limpopo into a knowledge economy and information society province,” said Altech Radio MD Brett Nash, adding that broadband telecommunications infrastructure was viewed as a basic essential utility and should be open to community members. The contract follows similar broadband roll-outs in Gauteng, which saw the successful implementation of the Gauteng Broadband Network, which resulted in the connection of 400 buildings, 45 Thusong Centres, 20 identified priority townships, nine economic development zones, six urban renewal nodes and several hundred schools under a build and transfer deal. The company is also in a joint partnership to design, deploy, maintain and operate a citywide backbone broadband network for the City of Tshwane.
