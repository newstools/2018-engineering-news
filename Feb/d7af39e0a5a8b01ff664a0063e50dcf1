The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has repaired 44 350 potholes across the city since the beginning of the 2017/18 financial year. The city currently has a backlog of R11.8-billion for upgrading the city’s 13 599 km road network, of which R7.1-billion is required for repairs to surfaced roads and R4.7-billion for the upgrade of gravel roads to tar.  
	 
	“City-wide, the JRA is faced with an R81.5-billion ten-year backlog to address the city’s ageing road infrastructure. Based on the 2017 JRA roads conditions study, we are faced with a 25% increase in the deterioration of the road network condition, from 89% to 64%. The excessive damage to our road network has resulted in a rise in pothole reports and increased safety concerns,” Transport MMC Nonhlanhla Makhuba said in a statement on Tuesday.
	 
	The JRA noted that it continues to prioritise pothole repairs, with R88-million allocated towards fast-tracking repairs and priority roads scheduled for upgrades. Since July 2017, 520 km of roads have been resurfaced, 32.26 km upgraded from gravel roads to surfaced roads and a total 300 m of open storm water drains have been converted to underground systems.
	 
	In an effort to enhance service delivery, the JRA is in the process of completing the installation of a R53-million asphalt plant. The new plant will improve efficiency and produce hot and cold tar mix through improved environment-friendly processes. It will also increase the supply of asphalt for pothole repairs and road surfacing to JRA’s road surfacing depot and seven regional depots.
	 
	The JRA said R240-million has been allocated towards resurfacing and reconstruction. The allocation is split with R140-million for resurfacing and R100-million for reconstruction. A further R295-million has been allocated towards the upgrading of gravel roads.
	 
	“At present, 32% of surfaced roads, which make up 3 968 km require reconstruction, 45% of surfaced roads, which make up 5 581 km, is in very good and good condition and 23% of surfaced roads, which make up 2 852 km, require resurfacing,” Makhuba said.
