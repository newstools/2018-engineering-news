The Competition Tribunal has confirmed an R8.43-million settlement agreement between railway construction and maintenance company Plasser South Africa and the Competition Commission.
	  
	On February 2014, the commission initiated a complaint against Lennings DEC Rail, a subsidiary of Aveng Africa, and Plasser over allegations of market division and cover pricing arrangements, which resulted in collusive tendering.
	 
	Plasser South Africa had admitted to colluding with Lennings in respect of tenders for railway construction and maintenance issued by Transnet between 1997 and 2013. The companies agreed to allocate railway construction and maintenance tenders among themselves.
	 
	Lennings had been granted leniency in line with the commission’s corporate leniency policy.
