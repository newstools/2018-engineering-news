Entrants will be assessed on their performance during the period from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017. The awards categories include most innovative company, best health and safety performance, best customer service performance, best corporate social initiative, the most transformed company of the year, the environmental stewardship award and the company that trained the most artisans in 2017. Entries will close on March 29.
