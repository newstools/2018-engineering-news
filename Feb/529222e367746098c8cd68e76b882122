The Western Cape cabinet has allocated another R82.5-million to fund drought relief measures, including new water augmentation and demand management projects in the water-strapped province. The additional funding will be focused on municipalities that border the City of Cape Town and which rely on the same water supply system as the city, namely Saldanha Bay, Drakenstein and Swartland. “We remain committed to assist the city in combating the ongoing drought crisis by reducing the pressure on the greater system,” said Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning Minister Anton Bredell.
