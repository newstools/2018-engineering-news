Aveng Grinaker-LTA on Friday confirmed that it would be retrenching some employees, but disputed the number of retrenchments reported by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on Thursday. The NUM on Thursday called on Aveng Grinaker-LTA to rethink its position to retrench, noting that it was worried and saddened that Aveng Grinaker-LTA is likely to retrench 2 863 workers at a time when there is a high rate of unemployment in the country. Aveng Grinaker-LTA, however, said only 120 permanent hourly-paid positions in the Aveng Grinaker-LTA Building business unit are currently affected, mostly owing to projects coming to an end with no future projects having been awarded to the company.
