The UK restaurant chain Las Iguanas will open its first restaurant in South Africa in Irene Mall, in Centurion, on June 7, franchisor Gold Brands said on Wednesday. The chain specialises in authentic Mexican, Brazilian and other South American food and cocktails, and the Irene restaurant will seat 200. "Las Iguanas will bring new flavours and exciting new Latin American dishes, along with their own unique Brazilian bottled Las Iguanas Magnifica Cacha√ßa," Gold Brands said. The restaurant created 60 new jobs across a range of positions including chefs, kitchen assistants, bartenders and waiters. An additional two positions have been created at Gold Brands' head office including a head chef and an operations manager. "South Africans are always hungry for new places to dine and Las Iguanas will fill the gap with this fantastic, well established concept," said South Africa's only AltX-listed fast food retail company Gold Brands COO Stelio Nathanael in a previous statement. Las Iguanas will be open for breakfast, lunch and dinner seven days a week, with specials added daily.
