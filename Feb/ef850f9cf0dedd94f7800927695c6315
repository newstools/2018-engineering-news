Cement producer PPC has appointed Johan Claassen as CEO and executive director of the company. Claassen has served as interim CEO for a number of months, with PPC chairperson Peter Nelson noting that he has overseen a number of important milestones, including the successful stabilisation of the business, an improvement in efficiencies following the completion of key projects and the strengthening of PPC's financial position. In addition, he notes that Claassen has developed strong relationships with a number of important stakeholders, not least the PPC board, executive team and the company's broader management team. "He has demonstrated that he has the right set of skills to effectively lead the company by balancing operational and financial considerations to leverage our quality assets across the continent, improve our profitability and deliver sustainable long-term returns for our stakeholders. After due process and all considered, the board confirms the appointment and looks forward to working with Claassen," Nelson commented.
	
	Claassen was previously PPC Cement RSA MD and has served as a member of the group executive team since January 2013. Meanwhile, Njombo Lekula, who was previously MD of Rest of Africa Cement, has been appointed MD of SA Cement. Mokate Ramafoko, in turn, succeeds Lekula as MD of Rest of Africa Cement.

The profile of our executive management team is further enhanced by these appointments, in line with our transformation agenda," Nelson concluded.
