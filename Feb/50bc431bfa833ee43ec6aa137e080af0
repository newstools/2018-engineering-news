South African property developer Atterbury has started construction on Old Mint Park, a prime industrial development neighbouring the landmark South African Mint and fronting the N1 highway, centrally located between Midrand and Centurion.
	
	The R800-million project entails the development of a new 65 000 m2 industrial park and is a joint venture between Atterbury and Old Mutual Properties.
	
	The first building under construction is a business unit development offering premises ranging from 500 m2 to 2 500 m2 in a single 10 000 m2 building. Concurrently constructed with this is a second building of 4 500 m2 of warehouse and office space.
	
	Atterbury development manager Derrick Pautz reports that earthworks for this development started in December 2017, with the business units expected to be completed and available for occupation by the end of this year.
	
	"Old Mint Park has been well received by the market. Fortuna Food has already signed the first lease at the business park for a 2 000 m2 unit. They will start trading from their new facility from October," Pautz highlighted.
	
	One of the development's biggest drawcards is its location - positioned centrally between Johannesburg and Pretoria, where Midrand meets Centurion. It has frontage on the busiest stretch of highway in Southern Africa and is situated between the N1 Brakfontein interchange, Old Johannesburg and Pretoria Main roads, and the Samrand on- and offramps. Old Mint Park is also located directly opposite the future Samrand Gautrain station and adjacent to the future K220 road, which is incorporated into its master plan.
	
	"Old Mint Park's prime position in a major established and growing business node central to the Gauteng business hub makes it a great asset for business. It benefits from excellent connections to major transport routes, sweeping highway visibility and convenient surrounding residential, education and healthcare facilities," said Pautz.
