Civil rights organisation AfriForum and Water Shortage South Africa (WSSA) have teamed up to implement an emergency water plan – the establishment of emergency water points in Cape Town to ensure the vulnerable have access to water should Day Zero occur. Three water points are planned across the city, with the first being set up at AfriForum’s sister organisation Solidarity Helping Hand’s donation offices in Cape Town, said AfriForum head Marcus Pawson. The first water point will include a 10 000-litre water tank, filled with SANS 241 standards-compliant donated water, to provide the scarce resource to people daily from Monday to Saturday. The other two water points will each provide 20 000 litres of water daily. Pawson explained that AfriForum’s country-wide branch structures were used to collect water, while the Cape Town branch would manage the water points. It will also be a point to drop off plastic bottles for recycling. Further, the branches will also distribute water disinfecting products in areas where there is a risk of water pollution. WSSA is currently collecting bottled spring water in Gauteng from over two dozen drop-off points, said WSSA CEO Benoit Le Roy. The company said water was donated by individuals, religious organisations and companies, with the loads consolidated by volunteers and sent to Cape Town by donated transport, for distribution. More than 100 000 litres a week have been transported to Cape Town for the past two weeks.
