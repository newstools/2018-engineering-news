The Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works (DTPW) has started a R14-million project to build a new slipway and truck arrestor bed on the downward slope of the N2 near Sir Lowry's Pass road, in Cape Town. The project is expected to be complete by August and construction will take place during the day from Mondays to Saturdays. All work will be carried out in the road shoulder and no road closures or obstructions are expected. The N2 will be widened at this point to a maximum of 13 m and the length of the slipway and arrestor bed will be about 850 m. The governmental organisation responsible for maintaining wilderness areas and public nature reserves, Cape Nature, has agreed to permit the necessary clearing of indigenous vegetation. The contractor will ensure that the impact on other indigenous vegetation is kept to an absolute minimum. New road markings will be added to the N2 when the works are complete. Meanwhile, the DTPW said it would use this opportunity to create short-term Expanded Public Works Programme employment and skills training opportunities. "During the course of this project, a total of R182 500 will be spent on targeted local labour, and 3 000 person-days of work will be created for people from Sir Lowry's Pass Village," it highlighted.
