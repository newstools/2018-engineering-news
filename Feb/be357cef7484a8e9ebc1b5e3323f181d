JSE-listed information and communication technology (ICT) multinational EOH has acquired Linux-focused enterprise open-source technology company LSD Information Technology (IT) to lead its open-source offerings in Africa. The acquisition, the value of which was not disclosed, addresses an identified gap in the market. The value and innovation that open-source solutions provide helps to address this gap and enables EOH customers’ digital transformation journeys, EOH ICT CE Rob Godlonton said on Monday. LSD IT’s offerings across Linux, automation, Dev-Ops and IT containers is a great technology fit for EOH to lead open source in the market. “We have a long-standing relationship with LSD IT. Its introduction into the EOH family complements our value proposition. We believe our customers will derive great value from our joint solutions as open source becomes increasingly integral to our customers' ICT strategies,” he said. “Being part of EOH enhances our ability to scale and meet the growing open source demand. The acquisition of LSD reinforces the recognition by the market that open source provides significant strategic and operational benefits,” said LSD IT MD Stefan Lesicnik. “The opportunity created by LSD IT and our ICT business is significant. It is a reflection of the strides we are taking in continuing to grow and lead the technology services industry on the continent,” concluded Godlonton.
