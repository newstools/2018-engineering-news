British new car registrations fell 6.3% in January, in part due to customers being put off from buying diesel models which politicians have targeted over air quality concerns, an industry body said. Total new sales stood at 163,615 units with demand for diesel vehicles declining by an annual 25.6% while petrol cars rose 8.5%, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. "The ongoing and substantial decline in new diesel car registrations is concerning, particularly since the evidence indicates consumers and businesses are not switching into alternative technologies, but keeping their older cars running," SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said.
