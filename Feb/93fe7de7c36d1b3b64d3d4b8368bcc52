Global project management consultancy Turner & Townsend’s Kenyan business will merge with Nairobi-based project management firm Mentor Management Limited (MML), after Turner & Townsend acquired a majority stake in MML from growth markets investor Actis. In line with global investment stimulating Kenya’s economy, the new entity – MML Turner & Townsend – will operate across the real estate, infrastructure and natural resources sectors. Turner & Townsend chairperson and CEO Vincent Clancy said the merger with MML will result in MML Turner & Townsend becoming the “largest independent” project and programme management company in East Africa. “This is the next step in our Africa expansion plan as we continue to grow across the continent.” Construction activity in Kenya, most notably in infrastructure, is being driven by institutional and private investment from overseas. Major projects have been helping to grow inbound investments in surrounding construction developments, including the Northern Corridor Transport Improvement project, the Lamu Port and Lamu Southern Sudan-Ethiopian Transport Corridor (Lapsset), the Lokichar to Lamu pipeline corridor, the new Mombasa-Nairobi Expressway and the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway project. Lapsset, in particular, will expand port access to Kenya, boost rail construction and include a pipeline for recently discovered oil in the country. MML MD John Rogers noted that joining Turner & Townsend is a significant step for MML employees and clients. “Turner & Townsend’s global expertise combined with MML’s local knowledge and reputation, will deliver a unique proposition to clients.” Turner & Townsend’s existing team will join MML’s Nairobi operation, as a combined team of over 40 experts, delivering a range of services including advisory, programme management, project management and cost management.
