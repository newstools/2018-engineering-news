Transnet Freight Rail’s (TFR’s) Container and Automotive Business (CAB) unit railed 909 295 t in February, surpassing its previous record of 878 462 t. The Natal Corridor (Natcor) Channel, meanwhile, railed 395 129 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in the year to date, compared with the 377 593 TEUs railed in 2016/17. “This exceptional performance owes its achievement to increased export containers railed from TFR inland terminals to Transnet Port Terminals’ Durban Container Terminals. “This achievement is further evidence of the effects of Transnet’s success in migrating rail-friendly general freight cargo back to rail,” TFR noted in a statement issued on Tuesday.
