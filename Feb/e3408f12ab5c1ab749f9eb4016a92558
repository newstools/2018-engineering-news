Day Zero has again been pushed back by another month as daily water use in the drought-stricken province drops by three-million litres, with the average consumption averaging 523-million litres a day. While still short of the 450-million-litre a day target, Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane on Tuesday said this contributed to extending Day Zero from June 4 to July 9. Further, the Groenland farmers association provided further private water transfers, joining others in the agricultural sector and many businesses in curbing water use and contributing to the continual push-back of Day Zero. In mid-February, Day Zero was pushed back to June 4, owing to reduced water use of 529-million litres a day, which, at the time, represented the lowest daily consumption achieved to date. Day Zero had initially been expected to occur in April, but was later pushed out to May owing to the drop in agricultural water use.
