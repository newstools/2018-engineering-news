A full investigation is under way to determine the root cause of an incident at the Gautrain depot, in Midrand, in which one employee was killed and another two injured. The accident occurred at about midnight on February 6, when a maintenance rail-road vehicle, which the deceased employee was operating, collided with the depot and maintenance equipment inside the depot. Owing to a loss in traction power, the four-car train had been stranded just before the Midrand station, on the way back to the depot from Hatfield, at the end of service. The maintenance rail-road vehicle was being used to tow the four-car train back to the depot. The train was not in service at the time and, therefore, no passengers were on-board. Gautrain notes that the two injured employees have been hospitalised and remain in a stable condition. Gautrain services are operating according to schedule.
