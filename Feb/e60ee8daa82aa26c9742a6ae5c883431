Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has concluded negotiations and signed an agreement for the manufacture, supply and delivery of two new helicopters to service the Durban and Richards Bay ports, as part of its helicopter marine pilotage service - one of only three countries in the world to do so. The AgustaWestland (AW109) helicopters, valued at about R250-million, are being procured from Italian aerospace and defence group Leonardo S.p.A., formerly Leonardo-Finmeccanica, Finmeccanica, and AgustaWestland. They are expected to be delivered by June next year. The AW109 series includes a twin engine and a harbour pilot kit that features a hoist to enable this unique operation. TNPA CEO Shulami Qalinge said clients would welcome the prospect of improved operational efficiency and safety in TNPA's marine aviation service. "Richards Bay and Durban are the only ports in our complementary port system which use helicopters to transfer marine pilots onto and off visiting vessels. We have an existing fleet of three AW109 helicopters and this purchase forms part of the fleet replacement programme. "We are delighted that we are now in a position to respond to long-time industry calls. The acquisition of new helicopters has been a priority for us under the Transnet market demand strategy which among others seeks to improve operational efficiency and safety in our ports." The contract for the new helicopters includes a 25% supplier development obligation by the global supplier to ensure that the contract creates socioeconomic benefits within South Africa. These would include job creation, skills development and where possible use of local, empowered companies and local materials or parts.
