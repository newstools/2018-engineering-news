The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) has announced that March 1 and 2 have been earmarked for public hearings into the second draft of the End-User and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations. Following the receipt of 13 written submissions, the communications authority will undertake oral representations at its Sandton headquarters to unpack the general concern around the perceived high cost of data, in addition to the expiry of data bundles and out-of-bundle business rules applied by network service providers. “The regulations seek to protect the rights of consumers by, besides others, ensuring that they are provided with sufficient information that will assist them in making informed decisions; as well as facilitate redress for those consumers who have been unfairly treated by network service providers, where applicable,” the authority said in a statement on Tuesday. The schedule of the public hearings will be published in due course.
