The South African Property Owners Association (Sapoa), under the leadership of president Peter Levett, continues to focus on education, advocacy, transformation and research in the property sector. Sapoa plays a “pivotal role” in advocacy, providing targeted participation in legislative developments that will affect Sapoa members directly. In addition, Levett noted at a media lunch on Tuesday, that the organisation, in line with its mission statement, participated in the 2017/18 Integrated Development Plan (IDP) process at a regional level. He further highlighted that Sapoa continues to be a major supporter of transformation in the industry. He adds that the organisation has, to date, contributed about R2.5-million to the running expenses of the Property Sector Charter Council (PSCC). Levett further highlighted Sapoa’s continued research papers to the industry, through which the organisation continues to aim to be a source of credible and reliable information for the industry. Meanwhile, Sapoa also welcomed the City of Cape Town’s decision not to proceed with a drought charge, but did express concern about increasing water tariffs and the heavy penalties payable for excess water use in the city. The association had strongly objected to the implementation of the proposed drought charge.
