	Alstom Ubunye has unveiled its latest educational initiative, a new welding school at a Secondary School in the Duduza township near Nigel. Natasha Odendaal tells us more. Natasha Odendaal:
	In an effort to create a strong pipeline of trained welders for the skills-strapped manufacturing industry in South Africa, the Alstom Foundation’s new Esibonelwesihle Welding School will start equipping Grade 10 to 12 high school students with much-needed welding skills. Alstom Welding School trainer Solomon Thena discusses this further. Alstom Welding School trainer Solomon Thena: Natasha Odendaal:
	Started in January, the Mechanical Technology: Welding and Metalwork subject now forms part of the technical scope of the senior school learners. The project also feeds into Alstom Ubunye’s own in-house accredited welding school at its 80 000 m2 facility, in Nigel, which absorbs ten welding learners each year. The candidates graduating from the Welding School will have the opportunity to apply for a position in the accredited programme to further their skills or take what they have already learnt to market.
