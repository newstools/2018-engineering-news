The African National Congress (ANC) said in a terse statement that it will on Tuesday at noon pronounce on President Jacob Zuma's fate. All indications are that the ruling party's top brass has decided to force Zuma out after a marathon 13-hour closed meeting. Media reports say the national executive committee - the ANC's highest decision-making body between conferences - resolved to recall Zuma after he refused to resign. The scandal-ridden president had reportedly offered to resign, but only in July - something the ANC flatly refused to entertain. Zuma has since told the ANC to "do what it wants to do".
