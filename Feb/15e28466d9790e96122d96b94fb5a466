Fleet management and vehicle tracking group Cartrack has launched a R9.99-a-month theft-only insurance product. The JSE-listed group on Friday said the “first-to-market innovative insurance offering for vehicle theft” targeted the uninsured market in South Africa. According to the Automobile Association of South Africa, around 70% of the more than 12-million registered vehicles in the country are uninsured. “Leveraging its audited 93% recovery rate, wealth of insurance telematics data and investment in research and development, Cartrack is able to offer theft-only vehicle insurance at R9.99, subject to terms and conditions, if a Cartrack telematics device is installed,” said the group in a statement. “Through this new and innovative low-cost theft insurance product, we’re seeking to provide an essential service to the uninsured,” commented Cartrack CEO Zak Calisto. “The theft of a vehicle, and in many cases, with no means to fund a replacement, is a real threat for lower-income families facing financial pressures. This type of limited insurance is vitally important to protect against the risk of vehicle theft.” Cartrack on Friday also announced growth of more than 85 000 subscribers since September 1, 2017, to a total of more than 750 000 subscribers globally. The year-on-year subscriber growth to date is around 25%.
	 
	Calisto attributes this double-digit growth to Cartrack’s investment in operating and distribution capacity. “This growth in subscribers also puts us in the position to introduce even more value propositions to the market. “Special focus for us will be workforce optimisation, which leverages all available telematics to improve the productivity of assets and people through technology, and insurance telematics. We still see ourselves as a start-up and are undergoing increased investment in our systems and services.” Cartrack has a presence in 24 countries spanning across Africa, Europe, the US, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.
