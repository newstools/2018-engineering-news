France's Total expects to take a final investment decision (FID) on liquefied natural gas (LNG) import projects in Myanmar and Côte d'Ivoire this year as part of the oil major's expansion into emerging markets, an executive said on Wednesday. Jean-Pierre Mateille, vice president of trading at Total Gas & Power UK, said the company should reach FID for a project in Myanmar with a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), LNG supply and two power plants in the second half of 2018. Total is ready to trigger its second major LNG infrastructure project in Côte d'Ivoire as soon as the government gives the green light, he added.
