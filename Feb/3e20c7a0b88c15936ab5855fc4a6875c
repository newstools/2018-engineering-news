The National Treasury on Monday encouraged South Africans to share their views about the country's economy and other issues they would like government to highlight when Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba delivers his 2018 Budget Speech, in Parliament, on February 21. South Africans are invited to share their views on the funding of free education for students in tertiary institutions, how South Africa can achieve inclusive economic growth, as well as how the country can use its resources to ensure efficiencies. South Africans are also invited to comment on how the government, civil society, unions and businesses can work together for the purpose of achieving South Africa's economic objectives. Contributions can be submitted through the National Treasury website, or to the Treasury's social media account on Twitter, by using #BudgetTips2018 and following the institution at @TreasuryRSA
