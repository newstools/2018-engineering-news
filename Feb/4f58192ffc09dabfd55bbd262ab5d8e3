SNC-Lavalin has been awarded a $12.4-million contract for the February 2018 refinery turnaround at the Engen crude refinery, in Durban, for Engen Petroleum. The scope of work on this project involves the planning, preparation and execution of all mechanical activities on the North Complex and Combo areas of the refinery, including the management of subcontractors. The mandatory shutdown of the refinery to undertake statutory inspections and remedial works is required to ensure that production outputs are maintained for market requirements and consumption. The refinery is a national key point and produces 120 000 bbl/d of refined crude oil, which includes petrol, diesel and aviation fuel, as well as various crude by-products. Engen is also a major supplier of fuels and lubricants to South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. “We have worked with Engen for over a decade and previously completed several yearly shutdowns. This strong business relationship gives us the opportunity to, once again, demonstrate our capabilities and deliver exceptional service to the Engen Refinery,” SNC-Lavalin sub-Saharan Africa GM Stuart Kent said.
