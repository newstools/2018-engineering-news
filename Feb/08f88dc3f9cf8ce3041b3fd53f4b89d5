University of South Africa (Unisa) Unesco-Unisa chair in nanosciences and nanotechnology Professor Malik Maaza has been awarded the African Union (AU) Kwame Nkrumah Award for Scientific Excellence (Auknase), recognising his pioneering work in science and technology. The award is the AU's the highest level of the Auknase programme and celebrates top African scientists for their valuable achievements, research and discoveries.
	
	"Professor Maaza and the team under his leadership have been the first worldwide to report several scientific phenomena. Carrying the bulk of his research in South Africa generally, he pioneered world-class nanoscience research within the continent and at the international level. "It is his sustainable inclination towards excellence and originality in his research outputs that have been acknowledged via several national and international awards and accolades," said Unisa principal Professor Mandla Makhanya.
	
	Maaza said it was a "great honour" to be associated with giants in education. "In Africa, we have giants who give huge importance to education," he added.
	
	The Commission of the AU is committed to supporting the use and development of science in Africa and has been running the Auknase awards since 2008. The award is in commemoration of Ghana's first President Dr Kwame Nkrumah.
