The Coega Development Corporation (CDC) this past week launched its inaugural supplier development day at the Vulindlela Accommodation and Conference Centre, in Nelson Mandela Bay. The event, which is a first by a special economic zone, saw captains of industry together with emerging businesses under one roof discussing various topics prevalent to business, including access to finance, procurement opportunities and regulatory compliance, said CDC marketing, brand and corporate head Dr Ayanda Vilakazi. The event, which is an initiative of the CDC under the theme 'creating connections, building bridges for success', facilitated access to information for small, medium-sized and microenterprises (SMMEs) on opportunities, as well as on enterprise development programmes, Vilakazi added.
