The leaking of the Eskom draft preliminary inquiry report which has reportedly implicated former minister Lynne Brown and Malusi Gigaba is "scandalous and embarrassing", chairperson of the Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee Zukiswa Rantho has said. Rantho spoke to Fin24 by phone on Monday morning after Business Day earlier reported that Brown and Gigaba, both former public enterprises ministers, were among those named that could face criminal investigation based on the report. According to Business Day, the report lists 44 people and 25 companies, including senior staff from McKinsey and KPMG. However, the draft preliminary report has yet to be adopted by the public enterprises committee, and must still be sent to those implicated for comment, Rantho said. "The people that are being implicated in the report have not received the report yet. They have to get the report. The report has not been adopted by the committee." Rantho said she was not sure who leaked the report to Business Day, and that she will report this to the committee members today. The committee is scheduled to have a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the annual report of state entity Alexkor. When asked when the committee would adopt the report, Rantho said that she was not sure, as the leakage may impact the work of the committee. "We have got this scandalous thing, embarrassing thing [that has happened]. I'm not sure how it will affect committee work going forward." Previously, Fin24 reported that the committee resolved to recommend that criminal proceedings and investigations be instituted against those implicated. At the time Rantho did not name anyone, but told journalists some had appeared before the inquiry while others had not. Gigaba and Brown had both testified before the inquiry. The procedure was to give those named 14 days to respond to the report. The committee intended for the report to be presented before Parliament before the end of November.
