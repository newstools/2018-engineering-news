President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Thursday in his much anticipated Cabinet reshuffle the merging of the Telecommunications and Postal Services Ministry with the Communications Ministry, under the leadership of Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams. The merger will take place after the 2019 elections, after which Ramaphosa says government will make a comprehensive announcement on realignments. Current Communications Minister Nomvula Mokanyane will now head up the Environmental Affairs department. She takes over following the death of Edna Molewa. Ramaphosa says the merger is in line with the work undertaken to realign government and to ensure a better alignment and coordination of matters that are critical to the future of the economy, such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Ministry will now be headed up by Dr Siyabonga Cwele following the resignation of Malusi Gigaba. “In making these changes I remain determined that the Cabinet of our nation should have an appropriate mix of experience, capability and gender, as well as a generational mix. [It should also] have members who are mindful of the needs to have a resolute and stable Cabinet that is able to effectively lead [government’s] renewal and transformational effort,” said Ramaphosa. Deputy Minister of Energy Thembi Majola has also resigned, effective January 2019, to attend to family matters. Ramaphosa ended his address by wishing all Ministers well and extended his gratitude to all Ministers who have served.
