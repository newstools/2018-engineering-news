Former UK PM David Cameron has called for a move away from “strong man” leadership at a “dangerous” time for global politics. Speaking at the Discovery Leadership Summit, in Johannesburg, this week, he said these dangers included corruption, climate change, economic uncertainty and feelings of social, economic and political exclusion. These are contributing to a growing global trend of turning to “strong man leadership”. Cameron emphasised that the element of corruption is particularly rampant in South Africa, and is becoming accepted as the norm, which should not be the case. However, he said South Africa had the potential to “write a great story”, if it followed leadership that emulates the values of the late former South African President Nelson Mandela. He stressed the importance of leaders listening to and understanding people’s grievances in order to address disillusionment. THE CLINTONS Former US President Bill Clinton and former Presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton were also present at the event, and gave their thoughts on a number of global and local issues. Hilary analogised a good society to a three-legged stool, which stands when propped on three legs of a functioning and effective government; a productive dynamic and successful private sector; and a flourishing civil society. Moreover, these legs should be equal, but this is not the case worldwide. The two were bullish about democracies globally, with Hilary noting that, while there is a perception that democracy is not delivering the needs of people, governments should not be discouraged by populists and narratives that paint situations as worse than they are. “Democracy is worth its messiness,” said Bill. He highlighted South Africa’s democratic start, stating that more diverse groups engender better democracies than homogenous ones, and that this inclusive strategy should be pursued worldwide, rather than an “us-versus-them” rhetoric.
