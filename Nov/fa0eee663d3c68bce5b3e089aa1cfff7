The South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) has developed a new app that enables commuters to check and top-up the balances on their electronic toll accounts in real time.

"This app helps to make travelling on the Sanral road network easier and more comfortable and adds value for our account holders," says Sanral communications manager Vusi Mona. Sanral states that the app, which can be downloaded on all Android and iOS devices, also provides information about weather conditions, traffic congestion and incidents on the road.
