Wind turbine designer and manufacturer Nordex will double the number of local employees and install another 174 wind turbines on four wind farm sites in South Africa. Nordex South Africa MD Anne Henschel said the investment followed the signing of Round 4 of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme (REIPPPP), in which Nordex was awarded four projects and an additional 547 MW of wind capacity. “We see the doubling of our local workforce as a sign of our continued commitment to the South African wind industry,” said Henschel. The company, which has been active in South Africa for the past six years, will be installing its AW125 wind turbines on four sites. “We will also have local concrete tower production facilities close to all of the sites. By manufacturing these concrete towers locally, we are able to uplift the local communities,” added Henschel. Nordex Group has been awarded a total of nine REIPPPP contracts for wind turbine manufacturing and service maintenance, of which five projects are fully operational. With over 1GW, this will be highest amount of wind capacity provided by one wind turbine manufacturer in South Africa, once operational. The company is supplying turbines to the Roggeveld and Nxuba wind farms in the Eastern Cape, as well as the Copperton and Garob wind farms in the Northern Cape, which are all under construction. Through the REIPPPP, Nordex is also involved in projects at the Dorper, Kouga, Amakhala Emoyeni and Gibson wind farms in the Eastern Cape. It has also supplied wind turbines, with a total of 138 MW of power to Gouda wind farm in the Western Cape. All of these plants are up and running. Nordex Group has recently launched and installed the first N149/4.0-4.5, an onshore  wind turbine with the longest blade worldwide. Henschel said the turbine is very attractive for South African wind conditions, especially with a view to Round 5 of the REIPPPP.
