It is expected to be a busy Friday morning in Pretoria as the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa), the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and other civil organisations march against e-tolls.

The march is expected to start at 09:00 and proceed from Burgers Park to the Union Buildings.

On Monday, Cosatu provincial secretary Dumisani Dakile vowed to bring an end to the controversial e-tolls.

He said they were demanding answers from those who "took the decision to establish the e-tolls" and wanted to know why e-tolls were "so expensive".

While they were expecting masses to join the march, they said it would be peaceful.

Dakile said the momentum to have the system done away with was growing, especially now that they were joined by the African National Congress (ANC) and civil society organisations.

"We are quite certain because 95% are not paying this particular e-toll. We can tell without any doubt, that there is not even a single department in Gauteng that pays for this [thing]. The momentum is very high, so people must continue to boycott [it]."

Last week, the ANC in Gauteng reiterated its stance on the scrapping of e-tolls.

"Let there be no confusion, they are not part of the future of this province. We will have to work out how to pay for the roads but not through the e-tolls," provincial chairperson David Makhura said.
