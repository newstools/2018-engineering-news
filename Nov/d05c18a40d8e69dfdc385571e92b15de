Freight logistics group Transnet has appointed Tau Morwe as acting CEO for the six-month period from November 1, 2018, to April 30, 2019. The appointment has been approved by Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and follows on from the State-owned company’s decision to dismiss Siyabonga Gama in October, after Gama had failed to meet the board’s deadline for the submission of reasons as to why his contract should not be terminated. Morwe, who also joins the Transnet board, is a veteran of the organisation, having first been employed by Transnet in 1997. He worked for the group for 17 years, during which time he headed three divisions, including the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA), Transnet Freight Rail and Transnet Port Terminals. Morwe took early retirement in April 2015, when he also stepped down as TNPA CEO. He subsequently acted as a transport and logistics consultant in South Africa and rest of Africa. The axing of Gama represented the highest-profile board intervention undertaken as part of a broader executive cleanup at a corporation shrouded in allegations of corruption and ‘State capture’. The actions were initiated soon after Gordhan appointed Popo Molefe, on May 24, to lead a new board. However, even prior to that action Transnet accepted the resignation of Garry Pita as the group’s CFO. Over the past few months various executives and senior managers have been placed on suspension, including Transnet Engineering CEO Thamsanqa Jiyane, executive manager Lindiwe Mdletshe, group supply chain officer Edward Thomas and group treasurer Phetolo Ramosebudi. Ramosebudi subsequently resigned, but Transnet reserved its rights to exercise action against him. Transnet said in a statement that Morwe’s “crucial appointment” would help strengthen governance procedures and would add “much-needed impetus in ensuring that our state-run institutions are well-governed and serve the people of South Africa”.
