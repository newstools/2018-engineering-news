Western Cape Premier Helen Zille will oversee the signing of a deal with Liquid Telecom for a partnership on an expanded public WiFi network, the provincial government said. The expanded service will see a total of 1 600 public WiFi hotspot sites operate across the province with an increased data allocation and at faster speeds. The Western Cape government said its target was to have a province "where every resident in every town and village has access to affordable high speed broadband infrastructure and services, has the necessary skills to effectively utilise this infrastructure, and is actively using this in their day-to-day lives".
