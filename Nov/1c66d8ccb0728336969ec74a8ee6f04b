Zambia has started implementing measures aimed at transforming State-owned Zesco into a viable and efficient public power utility company, the government said on Thursday. Zesco has in the recent past been experiencing serious operational challenges, the chairman of the team put in place to implement the reforms, Roland Msiska said in a statement. Msiska, who is Secretary to the cabinet said the cabinet in 2017 commissioned a study which made recommendations aimed at addressing the challenges facing the power utility. The cabinet in July this year approved the recommendations and directed the setting up of the team whose overall objective is to turn Zesco into a viable company, Msiska said. The implementation team had since begun its work and would regularly update the public and other stakeholders on progress made, Msiska said, without giving further details.
