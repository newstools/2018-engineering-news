Business services consultancy Mindworx and UK-based digital and business transformation specialist Rainmaker Solutions have joined forces to accelerate the transformation of African businesses for the digital age. The partnership combines global innovation with local expertise and provides clients in South Africa, and the wider continent, with customer-first solutions delivered by small, high-impact and experienced teams, the parties said in a statement published on Monday. Mindworx CEO Jonah Naidoo said the companies could accelerate the work they are doing with “even the most tech-savvy clients, . . . putting them on a global footing”. He added that Rainmaker’s expertise would allow Mindworx to introduce new offerings, like design sprints, which give organisations the ability to produce a prototype of a product or service idea within a week. “Nowhere else in South Africa is this available,” he averred. Rainmaker CEO Jan Joubert, meanwhile, commented that both firms share an ambition to challenge the status quo and to help clients plan, implement and embed lasting change.
