JSE-listed information and communications technology (ICT) giant Allied Electronics (Altron) subsidiary Altech Radio Holdings has been rebranded as Altron Nexus. This follows on the parent company’s brand repositioning, which unites all its businesses under one brand identity. “Altron Nexus is aligning with our new Altron brand architecture that creates a direct association between Altron and its various businesses, ensuring that we go to market as one, in line with the One Altron strategy,” said Altron group executive: marketing Zipporah Maubane on Thursday. “Our new brand, Altron Nexus, truly resonates with what we do in defining us as an ICT solutions partner that is the connection or link at the crossroads of our customer’s digital journey,” Altron Nexus MD Brett Nash added. As Altech Radio, the unit business initially derived its revenue from two-way radio communications; however, branded as Altron Nexus, the group will provide broadband solutions while remaining the largest provider of mission critical public safety solutions in sub-Saharan Africa, he explained. “We would like customers and partners to see us as innovators and integrators in both the broadband and narrowband space, enabling dynamic growth and transformation by connecting people, businesses, government and cities to a new and smart digital future,” he said.
