Hot on the heels of the Vaal river and Randfontein water pollution investigations currently under way, the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) intends investigating complaints over sewage spillages and wastewater treatment challenges in various municipalities in Mpumalanga. The local SAHRC office will kick off a provincial inquiry with the first hearings being held on November 29 in the Nkomazi local municipality and on November 30 in the Lekwa local municipality. The inquiry may also include unannounced inspections. In the last few years, the SAHRC in Mpumalanga has received a number of complaints alleging that the sewage spillages and/or the inadequate treatment of wastewater violated the affected communitiesâ€™ human rights. They referenced, in particular, the right to an environment that is not harmful to their health and wellbeing, the right to clean water and the right to dignity. The inquiry will test the veracity of the complaints received and explore any possible resolutions. Over the past two months, the commission has been investigating similar issues in the Vaal river region and in Randfontein. A technical team from the South African Defence Force is currently on the ground at the Sebokeng wastewater treatment plant, in Vereeniging, to rehabilitate aging and failing infrastructure. SAHRC also headed to Randfontein following complaints by residents that raw sewage was flowing from the Randfontein sewage processing plant into Tweelopiespruit.
