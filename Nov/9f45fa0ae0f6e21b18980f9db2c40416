Eskom group capital division executive Abram Masango has resigned, the Mail & Guardian reported on Friday. This follows after Eskom's announcement earlier in the day that it had suspended him, pending an investigation into various allegations of impropriety against him relating to the Kusile power station build project. “While we recognise his rights to be presumed innocent, . . . given the serious nature of the allegations made against him and the seniority of his position in Eskom, the Eskom management took a decision to place him on suspension pending the outcome of the investigation. “The board and management of Eskom is committed to investigating all allegations of impropriety involving Eskom and to hold those involved accountable as part of restoring good governance in our organisation,” the utility said in a statement published on Friday.
