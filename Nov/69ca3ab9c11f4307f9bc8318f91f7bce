JSE-listed property developer Attacq and wealth management firm PSG Wealth on Friday held a sodturning ceremony to officiate the development of the Ingress office park, in the Waterfall precinct, in Midrand. PSG will take up residency in a four-storey 4 376 m2 building, with the construction deadline set for August 2019 at Ingress’ Phase 1 development. The R500-million Ingress development will comprise five buildings functioning separately, which Attacq is still discussing with potential tenants, totalling 20 000 m2 of gross leasable area. The Ingress is situated near the Mall of Africa and is the latest in a line of Attacq developments, which include the PricewaterhouseCoopers tower, the BMW regional distribution centre, the Cummins head office and the Deloitte headquarters, which is under construction with completion planned for the second quarter of 2020. PSG CEO Marilize Lansdell commented that the company wanted its offices to have the appropriate stature, visibility and ease of access. “Waterfall’s close proximity to the surrounding business nodes, airports and infrastructure was a key consideration, as was ease of access for our employees and the convenience of the multi-use complex, which offers a variety of amenities.” The Ingress prioritises a number of green building-focused measures, such as green infused shading and paving. All buildings within the precinct include alternate glass solutions, flush glazing, external louvres and deep-set windows. Combined, these components work to ensure that all buildings perform to the highest environmental standards. PSG chairperson Willem Theron noted that about 300 PSG Wealth employees would be stationed within the new offices. Attacq CEO Melt Hamman said the company had spent R10-billion over the last eight years in developing and expanding the Waterfall precinct. Another R20-billion is earmarked for investment over the next 15 years.
