Former Thebe Investment Corporation chairperson Vusumzi (Vusi) Khanyile has been elected the new chairperson of World Wide Fund-South Africa’s (WWF-SA) board of directors at the nongovernmental organisation’s fiftieth annual general meeting. He takes over from Valli Moosa, who has chaired the board since 2011. Among WWF-SA’s priorities for the next financial year will be securing South Africa’s strategic water source areas, while extending work on water in Africa with the other WWF offices on the continent. This includes work in the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, which is located in a region of Southern Africa where the international borders of five countries converge, and a project focusing on the continent’s river basins. Another key focus area will be the socioeconomic review to improve the understanding of the interrelationship between South Africa’s key challenges of poverty, unemployment, inequality and environmental sustainability. CEO Morne du Plessis on Friday said that as the WWF-SA celebrates its fiftieth anniversary this year, its work will increasingly focus on building partnerships, finding innovative ways to adapt to the effects of a changing climate, as well as sustaining and improving human wellbeing. “There is no doubt in my mind that, with the right people, resources and motivation, we will succeed in building a sustainable, equitable future where both people and nature thrive,” he said. Moosa will continue to work with and support the WWF-SA in his capacity as trustee.
