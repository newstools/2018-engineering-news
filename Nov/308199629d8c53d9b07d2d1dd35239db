South African Airways (SAA) has assured its stakeholders, customers and suppliers of its business continuity after government confirmed that the airline will not be shut down or sold. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan last week clarified government’s position that, while the airline would continue to operate, there was heightened expectation for SAA to execute on its strategy to restore the airline financially and operationally, with more commitment and a greater sense of urgency. Gordhan said the public was losing patience with SAA and urged the airline to work with government to turn into a profitable business again. Meanwhile, SAA welcomed the assurance by President Cyril Ramaphosa in Parliament last week that the airline will remain in business, but that government was considering the option of bringing in an equity partner. SAA said in a statement issued at the weekend that its strategy implementation remained on track and that there are green shoots indicating positive results on initiatives that had already been implemented, particularly in the airline’s route network.
