South Africa is warming up, with a current estimated 4 ˚C to 6 ˚C increase in national temperature expected by 2050, compared with the global threat of a 4.5 ˚C temperature increase by 2100, Department of Environmental Affairs climate change director Reitumetse Molotsoane said on Tuesday. Speaking at the South African Energy Efficiency Confederation Conference, she said South Africa’s energy sector has the biggest potential to reduce carbon emissions, which causes trapped heat in the atmosphere. Department of Energy (DoE) clean energy acting deputy director general Mokgadi Modise, speaking on behalf of Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, stated that energy efficiency is a priority area for both the energy industry and policymakers. “Increasing energy consumption has led to technological breakthroughs that have improved energy efficiency over time. Energy security, access and managing climate change is at the centre of South Africa’s energy policies. “However, there are still unresolved areas, including insufficient awareness, education and training about energy management efficiencies; a lack of stabilisation in equipment and devices; and a lack of investment in energy efficiency improvements. “Renewables are being prioritised at the moment with funding, instead of energy efficiency,” noted Modise. Investment in energy efficiency measures from the private and public sectors is considered insufficient and the country must determine why that is, she added. The DoE is working on getting the post-2015 national energy efficiency strategy promulgated by Cabinet, she noted.
