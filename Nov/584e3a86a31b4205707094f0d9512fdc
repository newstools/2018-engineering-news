Steel producer ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA) has reported increased production and sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The JSE-listed company told shareholders on Thursday that liquid steel production increased by 4.8% to 59 000 t, mainly as a result of higher output from its long-products unit, where output had been curtailed in the corresponding period during 2017. The capacity utilisation for the period increased to 85% compared with 81% during the third quarter last year. The company said that, while domestic demand remained weak, local sales rose 2.8% period-on-period to 24 000 t, while apparent steel consumption increased by 2% compared to the  corresponding period. “Total imports of primary steel products decreased by 7% in the third quarter compared to that of 2017. Export sales increased by 13 000 t (6.4%) due to the strong international  demand and weakening of the average rand/dollar exchange rate.”
