The South African Revenue Service (Sars) on Friday said it has "noted" the announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa that he has fired suspended tax commissioner, Tom Moyane. In a terse statement, Sars said any enquiries in this regard must be directed to the Office of the Presidency. Moyane, who was sacked on Thursday, is mounting a legal challenge to his dismissal.
