In line with Kutana Steel Group’s long-term strategy, its member company Steeledale has appointed Chris Harito CEO, effective January 1. Harito previously served as the CFO of Steeledale under the leadership of outgoing CEO Schalk Burger. Burger has taken up a new role in mergers and acquisitions within Kutana Steel Group. “Chris and I have worked closely to realise the Kutana Steel Group strategy, so he is well placed to see its implementation through and oversee the continued growth of Steeledale,” Burger said in a statement issued on Thursday. Harito noted that he had gained valuable experience while working with Burger to develop great supplier partnerships and aligned the company to strategically position itself as an ideal partner for investments in infrastructure and in the mining sector. “Steeledale has been structured to take advantage of infrastructure and mining opportunities. With the support of an experienced team, Chris is well placed and has the expertise to drive these key markets in 2019,” said Steeledale chairperson Thoko Mokgosi-Mwantembe. Harito indicated that the past two years had been challenging for the steel industry. “This has required us to fast-track the implementation of our strategy, to ensure that we are well positioned for the future. Schalk has laid a great foundation by reshaping the company after the breakaway from Aveng. “I plan to maintain and secure more excellent supply partners, while creating a sustainable business. I am privileged to work with a dedicated and skilled team and have full confidence that, together, we will continue to move Steeledale forward,” he said.
