The city of Johannesburg said on Friday the first phase of a development in Bramley, in which its planning department had an imput, was now complete. It said mayor Herman Mashaba would on Monday join Africrest Properties in opening the Village and Spark School Development in the suburb. "The derelict and run down 30 000 square metre property in Bramley was developed with eager input from the cityâ€™s development planning department," it said. "The city saw a great opportunity to have input on the layout and design of the development to ensure a more responsible and responsive end product that strikes a balance between the pressure of the area-based transformation and existing communities." Phase 1 of the project includes a school and 200 affordable apartments.
