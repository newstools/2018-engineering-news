The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) has launched an inquiry into the mobile broadband market as part of its efforts and interventions to reduce the high cost of communication in the country. The notice of intention, published last week, is the third intervention by Icasa following the widespread public call for a reduction in the cost to communicate, particularly with regard to high data costs. “The market inquiry is seeking to assess the state of competition and determine whether or not there are markets or market segments within the mobile broadband services value chain which may require regulation in the context of a market review in terms of Section 67(4) of Electronic Communications Act,” said Icasa councillor Botlenyana Mokhele. The authority also published a questionnaire requesting information and opinions from market participants and interested stakeholders. “This information will be considered when defining those markets or market segments deemed to be relevant; evaluating the effectiveness of competition in the relevant markets; and determining which licensees have significant market power, and where competition is ineffective, in this regard,” Icasa noted. As part of efforts to deal with the high cost to communicate, Icasa, earlier this year, amended and published the End-User and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations and the Call Termination Regulations.
