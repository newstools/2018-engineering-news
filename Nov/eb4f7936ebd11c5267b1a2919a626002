Power utility Eskom on Thursday said it would implement Stage 1 load-shedding from 12:00 to 22:00. This is as a result of increased generation plant being out for planned maintenance and unplanned outages.
 
Stage 1 rotational load-shedding requires 1 000 MW to be loadshed nationwide.
 
"We encourage residents and businesses to please use electricity sparingly to ease the demand of electricity. Please switch off geysers as well as all nonessential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand," the utility said.
