The South African Institution of Civil Engineering (Saice) on Thursday inaugurated Brian Downie as the new president of the institution. Downie is the 116th president of Saice since the inception of the institution in 1903. The new president’s theme for 2019 – “It’s a new world” – is focused on education, entrepreneurship and employment, which are all vital issues for the country. The primary focus will be on education and will be achieved through the extension of existing initiatives with the Department of Basic Education (DBE), where engineers will offer tutorial support to Grade 11 and 12 pupils. “Today, with the advent of smartphones, we are proposing an ambitious relationship with the Khan Academy, which will offer a set of online tools to help educate students. The DBE already has the Khan Academy videos translated into isiZulu and isiXhosa,” Downie said in a statement. In parallel with the school initiative, Downie has also proposed a strategic technology partnership with The MakerSpace Foundation, which currently works with people from all ages and backgrounds, leveraging disruptive technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution such as three-dimensional printers, to help people make things that improve the world around them. “By lowering the barrier of entry for people to develop their own solutions using technology, The MakerSpace Foundation is inviting Saice members to become innovators and to innovate for good,” Downie explained. Google Impact Challenge South Africa is providing financial and logistical support to the initiative, which will assist in its expansion from seven locations, to 200, around South Africa. The third phase of the theme will empower young members to secure employment and to grow within the companies that they work for. In this regard, Downie called on young members of Saice to assist in the development of these strategies.
