Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) has appointed Bongiwe Mbomvu acting CEO, while the company is in the process of recruiting a permanent successor to outgoing CEO Bongani Maseko, who is stepping down on November 30. Under Maseko’s leadership, the King Shaka International Airport, in Durban, was developed while major expansions were undertaken at ACSA’s other airports. Mbomvu – a qualified attorney – is currently the group executive for governance and assurance at ACSA, a position she has held since 2013.
