The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has imposed an arms embargo on South Sudan as a measure to prevent the flow of weapons to armed groups in the war-hit nation. The members who backed the imposition of the ban believe such a move would help protect civilians, while others raised concerns that the policy would hinder the ongoing peace process in the nation, the Sudan Tribune reported. With nine votes in favour of the policy, the resolution was adopted obliging the 15-member UN body to immediately take necessary measures regarding the arms embargo, which will remain in effect until May 31 next year. The countries in favour of the resolution are Ivory Coast, France, Kuwait, Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Sweden, Britain and the United States. The remaining six countries which abstained from agreeing to the resolution include Bolivia, China, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan and Russia. Under the resolution, UN members states are obliged to prevent the entry of arms and related equipment of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary equipment and other spare parts, in South Sudan.
