Consulting engineering firm SMEC South Africa, with support from SMEC International, has been appointed by Ethiopian Petroleum Supply Enterprise to develop a white oil products storage terminal at Port Dukem, in Ethiopia. The facility will be the biggest among the country’s depots at 240 000 m3. The depot will also be the first in the country to store and handle aviation fuel, while being able to accommodate refined petroleum; white products receipt, storage and distribution, which comprises product storage tanks; tank truck and rail wagon receipt facilities and a tank truck loading gantry with allied piping and automation; and other facilities. SMEC will provide the services at the terminal on an engineering, procurement, construction and management basis in two phases. Phase 1 will include basic engineering, front-end-engineering and tender preparation and evaluation. Phase 2 will comprise construction supervision and support for the project’s implementation. “This project will showcase the company’s collective capability in delivering complex resources projects in Africa,” commented SMEC Africa resources GM Gerrit Lok.
