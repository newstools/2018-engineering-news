Following the meeting held on Thursday between Gautrain operator Bombela Operating Company (BOC) and trade union, the United National Transport Union, negotiations to find a settlement in the current wage dispute have resumed on Friday and will continue over the course of the weekend. If no settlement is reached, the strike will start on Monday, July 30, Gautrain spokesperson Kesagee Nayager told Engineering News Online on Friday. Should the planned strike go ahead, a reduced train and bus service will be operating. However, this will be dependent on the available resources, the spokesperson warned. BOC remains hopeful that an amicable settlement can be reached and expects to, by Sunday, inform passengers of the operational plan for Monday.
