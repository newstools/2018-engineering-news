South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has rejected the latest wage hike offer from state-run power firm Eskom and is ready to declare a strike from Tuesday if Eskom does not raise its offer, a union source told Reuters on Friday. The NUM is one of three labour unions locked in a wage dispute with cash-strapped Eskom, which initially refused to raise salaries this year. The union source, who did not wish to be named, said NUM had rejected Eskom's offer of around 6% and was holding out for as much as 12% in wage talks set to continue on Friday.
