Telecommunications giant MTN digital services, data analytics and business development VP Stephen van Coller has resigned, effective August 31, to take the reins at JSE-listed EOH Holdings on September 1. Van Coller joins EOH as group CEO following the announcement of a strategy shake-up that will see the group split into two distinct and independent businesses – EOH and Nextec. This followed the earlier appointment of Zunaid Mayet as Nextec CEO. The group’s leadership is now “structured optimally” and sets the foundation for its next phase of growth, with each of the companies owning their own unique brand and identity, business model, growth and go-to-market strategies. The EOH Holdings' corporate structure maintains responsibility for corporate finance, corporate strategy, group reporting, investor relations, risk and compliance. Van Coller, an accountant by training, joined MTN in 2016, playing an instrumental role in designing the telecommunication giant’s new “Bright” strategy and ensuring its focus on building out the new digital services areas. His successor at MTN will be announced in due course.
