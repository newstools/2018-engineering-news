As part of the City of Joburg’s Rea Vaya bus rapid transit (BRT) project along the Louis Botha Development Corridor, the Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA) is starting construction on the Watt street interchange, in Wynberg. To minimise the impact caused to the public, road users and pedestrians, the JDA advises that traffic diversions will be taking place in the area from July 5, with an anticipated construction period of 18 months. “Owing to the scale of this development we are making the public aware of the temporary road closure along Pretoria Main road, from Arkwright avenue to Thora crescent,” reports the JDA. The construction will include the demolition of the existing bridge and the interchange at Watt Street, the construction of a new link from Rautenbach avenue to Watt street with an upgrade of the intersection on Pretoria Main road, as well as the construction of new BRT lanes and an underground station, says JDA CEO Christo Botes. Watt interchange forms part of the Phase 1C of Rea Vaya, which includes the Section 8 trunk route from Sandton to Alexandra along Rivonia and Katherine drives, and the Section 15 trunk route from Parktown in Johannesburg to Alexandra along Louis Botha avenue. “The safety of the travelling public, and all affected parties is of utmost importance to us, and pointsmen will be deployed to assist with the flow of traffic at key intersections,” adds Botes.
