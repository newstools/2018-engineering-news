Trade union Solidarity has called ArcelorMittal South Africa’s (AMSA’s) proposed wage offer for this year “nothing but a slap in the face of hard-working employees”. The union on Tuesday said AMSA had proposed an increase of 6.5% in its contribution to employees’ medical aids. Further, it has offered an increase in wages of 6.5% for employees in the H-grade, 7% for employees in the I grade and 7.5% for employees in the J and K grades. “All our members work equally hard and that is why we believe a distinction should not be made between grades. We contend that all grades should receive an increase of 7.5% and that the medical contribution also be increased by 7.5%,” Solidarity metal and engineering industry deputy general secretary Marius Croucamp said on Tuesday.

Croucamp contends that the dispute against AMSA focuses specifically on the differentiation in percentage increases. He says the trade union hopes to reach an agreement by means of the dispute. “Solidarity remains committed to negotiate for a wage settlement,” he concluded. *A request for comment has been sent to AMSA.
