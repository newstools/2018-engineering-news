Aviation company ExecuJet, part of the Luxaviation group, is now the provider of major maintenance on Honeywell TFE731 engines in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India (EMEAI). ExecuJet’s Johannesburg-based maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility was awarded the rights by Honeywell International on June 26. “Our infrastructure at the MRO facility in Johannesburg is primed to support Honeywell’s maintenance operations for the entire EMEAI region,” ExecuJet MRO services executive VP Graeme Duckworth said in a statement issued on Tuesday. In addition to the TFE731, ExecuJet also carries full overhaul authorisation and on site test cell capability for Honeywell TPE331 engines, commonly found in smaller turboprops. “Becoming the provider of major maintenance for Honeywell’s TFE731 engines is a credit to the hard work and dedication to excellence of our engineers and technicians. We are delighted that Honeywell recognises ExecuJet’s experience in providing class-leading maintenance, and that we can extend this exclusive service to our customers.”
