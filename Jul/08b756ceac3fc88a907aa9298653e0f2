Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has appointed Thulani Mavuso acting director-general (DG) of the department, effective August 1. Mavuso will succeed outgoing DG Mkuseli Apleni. Mavuso is currently the deputy DG for institutional planning and support, as well as the acting deputy DG for information services. Nthumeni Nengovhela will take over as acting deputy DG for information services. Gigaba said these appointments would strengthen the management of the department, while ensuring that there is continuity following Apleni’s resignation. “While we will start with the recruitment processes for the new DG and deputy DG, we needed to put in place a strong team to continue to steer the department in the right direction as we seek to reimagine Home Affairs,” the Minister stated.
