Gautrain operator Bombela Operating Company (BOC) on Wednesday told Engineering News Online that it remains open to further wage negotiations with trade union, the United National Transport Union (UNTU), after its wage offer was rejected. BOC has requested a meeting with UNTU on July 26. An update regarding the potential trade union employee strike will be provided by the end of the week, the operator said. However, in the event of a strike, BOC does not expect its bus and midi-bus services to be impacted. “We will endeavour to implement a reduced train service depending on available resources; and passengers will be informed accordingly over the course of the weekend. During this time, the safety and security of our passengers will remain a key priority and will not be compromised.” UNTU rejected both offers tabled by BOC at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration on Tuesday. BOC offered an increase of 7% across the board, on basic salary and allowances, as well as a medical aid contribution of 50%, a collective bonus target of R8 000 per employee per year, equating to an overall increase of the bargaining unit of 8.6%. A second offer was also tabled, which included an increase of 8.5% across the board, on basic salary and allowances, plus medical aid contribution of 55% but without a bonus, equating to an overall increase of the bargaining unit of 8.4%. UNTU is demanding a 10% increase in employees’ basic salary, a R1 600 housing allowance, an R800 transport allowance or staff card use for office workers, as well as R64 for NWTS. Additionally, UNTU is also demanding a 10% increase in the night shift allowance and for employers to contribute 55% of employees’ medical aid contributions. The union is also seeking a R20 000 incentive bonus for all employees.
