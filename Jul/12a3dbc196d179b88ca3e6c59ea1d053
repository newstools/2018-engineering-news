South Africa’s home-grown apple juice brand Appletiser has expanded into Spain, with new market launches set to follow across Western Europe and the Americas. Coca-Cola sent out over 20 000 presentation kits to the Spanish market as an introduction and, as hoped, customers fell for the flavour. Appletiser is now stocked by over 43 000 customers across the country. Spain is the first big market, outside of South Africa, to launch the brand in Western Europe since Coca-Cola acquired the brand a little over two years ago. “We knew from the start that we have a very unique beverage in Appletiser, with a strong proposition, [comprising] 100% fruit juice, full of flavour, and ideal for non-alcoholic drinking occasions,” Spanish brand manager Óscar González Ramírez said in a statement on Monday. According to González Ramírez, it is the company’s strong belief in the brand proposition, combined with Appletiser’s local production in Spain, helped in building a close relationship with Spanish glass bottler Bilbao. “We are proud to see how this local brand has grown, first in its home market, and now in Europe and beyond. We look forward to supporting Appletiser as it expands into more of Coca-Cola’s territories,” Appletiser marketing head Andrea Shuttleworth said.
