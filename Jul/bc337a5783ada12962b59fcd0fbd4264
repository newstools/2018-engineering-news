Volvo Group Southern Africa has announced the appointment of Marcus Hörberg to lead the company’s local operations, with effect July 1. He replaces Torbjörn Christensson. Hörberg was the VP of Volvo Peru and Region North for the past five years. He has 20 years of experience in customer finance, business development, strategy and country management for the Volvo Group in emerging markets. “Frequently travelling to, and living in these markets, gave me a deep insight into how small and large corporations fail and succeed in new market economies,” says Hörberg. “I am passionately driven to create win-win situations for our customers and the society in which we are operating. I am a strong believer that value-driven organisations, with a culture of social responsibility, can contribute to our customers´ success and, at the same time, drive prosperity in these markets.”
