JSE-listed Murray & Roberts (M&R) will assess the impact of ATON’s acquisition of a 25.42% interest in JSE-listed Aveng. M&R, which is subject to a buyout offer by ATON, has launched a bid to acquire Aveng. M&R shareholders last month voted in favour of the proposed buyout of Aveng. Meanwhile, M&R has this week reiterated its call on shareholders to reject ATON’s R17 a share mandatory offer for all M&R shares, which it argues undervalues M&R’s strategic platforms and business prospects. The M&R board believes the cash offer remains below its assessed fair-value price range for control of between R20 and R22 a share. ATON is a significant shareholder in M&R, holding 44% of the company’s shares. M&R’s share price on the JSE was R17.44 at 15:55 on Friday, according to the bourse.
