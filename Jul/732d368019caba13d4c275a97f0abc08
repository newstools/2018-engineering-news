NTP Radioisotopes, a subsidiary of the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa), has reinstated three senior executives, who were put on special leave. A fourth executive had opted for early retirement. NTP says the reinstatement brings to an end a process which was initiated after a radiochemical complex incident that occurred in November last year. NTP chairperson Dr Namane Magau says it is important for NTP to regain stability and tackle challenges. The board puts this responsibility on the shoulders of all its critical employees so as to maintain the global standing of the organisation as one of the top three nuclear medicine global producers. The NTP board has resolved to review the organisational structure to enhance safety management within the organisation. The revised structure should improve efficiency in production, support services, marketing and sales, as well as strengthen safety and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
