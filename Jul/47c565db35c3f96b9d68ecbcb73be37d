The first phase of the Madibeng water purification plant, in North West, is projected to be completed by March 31, 2019, provided that an additional R100-million is made available in the current financial year for electrical and mechanical works of the plant, Water and Sanitation Minister Gugile Nkwinti has said. The estimated cost for completion of the first phase is about R528-million, he said in a Parliamentary reply this week. The construction of the second phase, which will provide an additional 20 Mâ„“, will start in the 2022/23 financial year, with construction to be completed by the end of the 2025/26 financial year. The estimated cost of the second phase, Nkwinti said, is about R701-million. He further highlighted that there are no plans to build additional reservoirs in Madibeng, owing to existing reservoirs in Letlhabile, Sonop, Maboloka, Mothutlung, Ouskral, Madidi, Mmakau, Jericho and Majakaneng. Further, new pipelines will be built to carry water to existing reservoirs in Madibeng, with construction projected to begin in the 2019/20 financial year. In addition, the pipeline from the pump station at the Crocodile river to the plant will be completed by the end of the 2018/19 financial year.
