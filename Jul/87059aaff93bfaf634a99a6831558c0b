Water and Sanitation Minister Gugile Nkwinti will on Thursday undertake a two-day Ministerial visit to Lesotho to see the developments around the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. "Minister Nkwinti will also have discussions with his counterpart from the government of Lesotho, Minister of Water, the Honourable Samonyane Ntsekele. These discussions will not just revolve on issues surrounding the Project, but will include other matters of dual interests to the Ministers and their respective governments," said a statement issued by the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS). "The DWS on behalf of the government of South Africa, is keen to ensure that the long-standing amiable relations between the two countries will continue to be strengthened by the continued technical and socio-economic activities guided by relevant agreements between the two countries, through the relevant departments responsible for the delivery of water to the peoples of both Lesotho and South Africa."
