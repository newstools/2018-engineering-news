Entries are open for engineers from South Africa and other sub-Saharan African countries to participate in the Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation. The deadline for entries is July 23. The Africa Prize, founded by the UKâ€™s Royal Academy of Engineering, is a six-month training programme which helps engineers become entrepreneurs through funding, bespoke mentoring and comprehensive business training. The shortlist phase recognizes 16 of the most talented engineers from across sub-Saharan Africa from a pool of entries. Candidates are selected and after six months of training, four finalists get to present their innovation to judges and a live audience, before a winner is chosen. In 2017, South African chemical engineer Collins Saguru was announced a runner-up winner at the prestigious awards for his metal reuse innovation, AltMet.
