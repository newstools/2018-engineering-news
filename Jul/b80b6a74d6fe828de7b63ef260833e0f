Graham Eagle has been appointed as the CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles South Africa (FCA SA), with immediate effect.  His appointment follows the recent resignation of Robin van Rensburg.  Under Van Rensburg’s leadership, FCA SA completed its transition into a single trading entity, as part of the global merger of the Fiat and Chrysler businesses. Eagle joins FCA SA with more than 40 years’ experience in the automotive industry. His career started as project engineer with Nissan. He left the Japanese manufacturer in 2001 to join Honda Motors Southern Africa as automobiles divisional manager, a position he held for four years before taking on the role of sales and marketing GM. He was promoted to sales and marketing director in 2009. In 2014 he was appointed as operational director. In April 2016, at the request of Honda Japan, he delayed his retirement beyond the company’s mandatory retirement age, taking on the role as Southern Africa operations VP. He completed two years in this role. Eagle is not a stranger to the Fiat brand, as he was instrumental in introducing the Fiat Uno to the South African market. (Fiat and Nissan had a contract manufacturing agreement in South Africa that officially ended in 2008.) FCA SA believes “Eagle’s formidable motor industry experience will be of major benefit to FCA, internally, to the dealer network and extended supplier base, to ultimately benefit customers”.

“I am excited to be joining the FCA family and I look forward to sharing my knowledge and experience in the FCA environment, elevating the brands to greater heights,” notes Eagle.
 
The FCA group includes Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Abarth, Fiat Professional, Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge and Mopar, the parts and service brand.
