The Department of Labour-led inquiry into the October 2015 collapse of the Grayston drive pedestrian and cyclist structural bridge this week completed its work of gathering evidence. It is now awaiting the submission of written heads of arguments by legal representatives of interested stakeholders by August 14. This will be followed by written responses to the heads of argument which are expected to be submitted by September 17. Stakeholders in the inquiry include the Johannesburg municipality as the client; the Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA) as the agent; Royal Haskoning DHV â€“ an engineering company appointed by the JDA as the engineering agent for the project; Murray & Roberts (M&R), as the principal contractor appointed by the JDA; Form-Scaff, as the contractor appointed by M&R; the people injured in the incident; the Engineering Council of South Africa; the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), representing the employees of M&R; and attorneys representing the Doodnath family, who were injured in the incident. The inquiry, which had its first sitting in February 2016, has faced several delays. It is now being led by presiding inspector Phumudzo Maphaha, who took over from Lennie Samuels who headed up the inquiry until late 2017.
