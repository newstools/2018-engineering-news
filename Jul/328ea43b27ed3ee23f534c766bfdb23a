The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) will be launching the inaugural Civil Aviation Industry Awards, with the aim to recognise individuals and companies for their contribution to the country’s aviation safety and security record. Civil aviation director Poppy Khoza said on Monday that the awards were taking place on the back of last year’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) aviation safety audit, which placed the country at the top position in Africa and in the thirty-third position globally. The ICAO will soon conduct an audit of South Africa’s aviation security. The awards will be assessed by an independent judging panel comprising eminent and accomplished individuals, which were chosen for their experience drawn from various aviation and business disciplines. A total of 14 awards can be won. “We have ensured that we have a wide range of categories to choose from, and as such, the winners will emerge from many different spheres of aviation, as each plays a pertinent role,” Khoza said, highlighting that SACAA wished to turn this into a yearly premier event that attracts the attention of aviation industry captains and every aviator in the country. “It would also be an immeasurable accomplishment if these awards could grow into a regional event that provides an opportunity to applaud all concerned. After all, aviation transcends borders,” Khoza pointed out. Khoza anticipates that the Civil Aviation Industry Awards will provide a platform to commend the contributions of individuals and companies that continue to contribute to the country’s remarkable aviation safety and security record. Award submissions will be accepted until September 13, with winners expected to receive the awards in October.
