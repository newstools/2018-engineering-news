Global commercial aerospace giants Airbus and Boeing have each reported hundreds of orders for their airliners at this year’s Farnborough International Airshow, currently under way in the UK. (The trade days being from Monday to Friday, with Saturday and Sunday the public days.) Boeing announced 673 “orders and commitments” for airliners and freighters, worth (at list prices) $98.4-billion. The group also announced orders and agreements worth $2.1-billion for commercial and defence services. Airbus reported “new business” for 431 aeroplanes, divided into 93 firm orders and 338 memorandums of understanding, but did not give a monetary value for these undertakings. The “commitments” for Airbus were composed of 60 A220-300s, 304 A320-family airliners, 42 A330neos (new engine options) and 25 A350 XWBs. The A220-300 was previously the Bombardier CS300, part of a small airliner family (the other, smaller, member of which was the CS100, now A220-100) recently acquired by Airbus. The A320-family aircraft are single-aisle airliners (larger than the A220s), while the A330 and A350 XWB families are wide-body airliners. “Notably,” highlighted the group, “the 42 commitments for the new A330neo includes both the -800 and -900 models – a strong endorsement at the show for this family.” For Boeing, its total included 564 for the next generation version of its 737 single-aisle airliner, the 737 MAX, of which 110 were for the largest version, the 737 MAX 10. Also within the total were 52 wide-body 787 Dreamliner aircraft, 48 777F wide-body freighters and five 747-8F extra-large freighters – “reflecting continued strengthening in the cargo market globally,” stated the company. “Boeing led the way at Farnborough, demonstrating value for our customers, capturing important new business in products and services, and announcing the unique strength of our strategic partnership with [Brazilian major aerospace group] Embraer. We also invested in our European communities, and launched our new Boeing NeXt organisation – proving the future is built here, at Boeing,” affirmed group chairman, president and CEO Dennis Muilenburg. “We will continue to win in the marketplace thanks to our talented team, who innovate across our enterprise with One Boeing collaboration and deliver on our proven portfolio with relentless customer focus.” Airbus, in its statement, noted that, during the first half of this year (before Farnborough) it had also won orders for 261 airliners, including 20 A380 Superjumbos. “Our year to date and our end of show commitments confirm the strong market appetite for all our leading aircraft product families,” averred Airbus chief commercial officer Eric Schulz. “I am especially pleased about the strong response that our wide-body family is enjoying. Over 150 orders and commitments for our A330/A350/A380 offerings in 2018 are a strong endorsement. At Airbus, we are positive about our future – in single-aisles, wide-bodies and the ‘middle of the market’ [category]. We are right there with the right aircraft.”
