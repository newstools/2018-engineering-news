Real estate investment trust Growthpoint Properties and private company Cintocare on Monday broke ground on the R450-million development of an 11 000 m2 special surgical head and neck hospital, in Pretoria, which will be the first green-certified hospital in Africa. The companies are creating a clinical centre of excellence that focuses exclusively on the head and neck, and spinal and vascular surgery with highly specialised medical professionals and high-end technology. The development partnership is delivering the full suite of services for the hospital – from inception to completion. The building will comprise seven floors – the hospital plantroom, three clinical and consulting levels and three parking levels. The 100-bed hospital, with the built-in capacity to expand to 160 beds, will have five theatres, one of which is a hybrid. A hybrid operating room is a surgical theatre that is equipped with advanced medical imaging devices such as fixed C-Arms, CT scanners or MRI scanners. These imaging devices enable minimally-invasive surgery. Construction of the hospital will begin in August. The building, which is located adjacent to Menlyn Maine Central Square, is scheduled for completion during the first quarter of 2020.
