Kenya Airways has become the first airline in Africa to contract US aerospace giant Boeing for its Consumable & Expendable Services package. The deal has a duration of five years and will initially cover more than 18 700 parts. In subsequent phases, the number of parts covered by the agreement will rise to 35 700. The deal also covers services, and these parts and services will support Kenya Airways’ fleet of Boeing airliners. The East African carrier will have access to a worldwide system of on-demand services and parts. This support from Boeing will allow the airline’s maintenance activities to be run at optimal efficiency. In consequence, it will increase the reliability and reduce the turnaround times for the airline’s fleet. “This programme will provide unparalleled support for our fleet of 737s and 787-8s and we expect to continue to grow our operations with increased reliability and quicker turnaround times,” affirmed Kenya Airways Chief Operating Officer Jan de Vegt. “Boeing’s Consumable & Expendable Services programme provides the most economical and comprehensive solution for Kenya Airways,” stated Boeing senior VP commercial sales and marketing Ihssane Mounir. “With this programme. Kenya Airways can rely on Boeing’s resources and global presence and focus on their core business of serving their passengers.” Kenya Airways’ Boeing fleet is composed of 14 737 single-aisle and eight 787-8 Dreamliner wide-body airliners. The 737 fleet is subdivided into two 737-300F freighters, four 737-700 airliners and eight 737-800 airliners. The 787s will inaugurate a new non-stop Nairobi/New York service in October. The only non-Boeing types in the Kenya fleet are 15 Embraer E190 regional airliners. Embraer and Boeing recently agreed to create a joint venture company which would include the Brazilian manufacturer’s commercial jets business.
