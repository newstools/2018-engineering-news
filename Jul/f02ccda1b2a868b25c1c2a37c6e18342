Tunisia and the African Development Bank (AfDB) have signed an agreement for the launch of a pilot project to use drones for data collection, which will enhance the management of agricultural projects in the country. The project will be implemented over the next ten months and will receive technical management and assistance from South Korea, Tunisia Development, Investment and International Cooperation Minister Zied Laadhari stated during the signing ceremony last week. The ceremony was attended by Busan City vice-mayor Park Jae-Min, AfDB North Africa director-general Mohamed El Azizi, Tunisia Agriculture Minister Samir Taïeb and Korea’s ambassador in Tunisia Cho Koo-Rae. The pilot project will focus on agricultural operations in Sidi Bouzid, in central Tunisia, under the management of Busan Techno Park – a Korean government agency based in Busan, South Korea. Laadhari said the agency would provide equipment – drones and associated computer systems – and training, as well as technology transfer. The agency has already tested the drones for efficacy in managing similar urban projects. Korea is a leading country in the development and use of unmanned aerial vehicles for real-time data collection and processing. Drones have been used in agriculture to provide fast and accurate data, helping to improve decision-making at all stages of a project, from preparation to implementation and evaluation. Laadhari noted that the pilot programme was expected to assist in  the monitoring of irrigated areas, and the management of water resources, water tables, and the effects of climate change in the pilot area.
