The University of Stellenbosch Business School (USB) has been ranked as the top business school in South Africa by Eduniversal – an international education rating agency based in Paris. The ranking is the result of voting by deans of business schools around the world, based on a list of criteria. The yearly ranking is divided into two categories – the top 1 000 global business schools in 154 countries and the top 4 000 Masters and Master of Business Administration (MBA) programmes. These rankings are designed to provide information to prospective students that will help them in their search for the best postgraduate programmes. “This Eduniversal vote of confidence from fellow business school directors and deans from around the world signals that we are realising our vision of being an African business school with an excellent global reputation,” said USB director Professor Piet Naudé. USB’s full-time MBA was also highly placed in Eduniversal’s top Masters ranking of 2018, being ranked in the top two full-time MBA programmes in South Africa. Two of USB’s other postgraduate programmes also featured in Eduniversal’s top Masters ranking – USB’s Master of Philosophy in Management Coaching was ranked number one in Africa in the human resources management category, while the postgraduate diploma in leadership development was ranked thirteenth globally in the leadership category.
