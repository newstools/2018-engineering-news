JSE-listed real estate investment trust Emira Property Fund’s R200-million The Bolton apartment block, in Rosebank, will start welcoming its first residents in August. Emira converted an office property block formerly occupied by petrochemicals giant Sasol into a contemporary residential apartment development. “The conversion caters to the demand for residential accommodation from working Millennials in this bustling business node. “The Bolton responds to an undersupply of residential accommodation in the area with a premium address in an excellent location, competitive rentals, high management standards and a compelling array of popular amenities,” says Emira COO Ulana van Biljon. The Bolton offers a mix of bachelor and one- and two-bedroom apartments, which range in size from 30 m2 to 60 m2. The next batch of 39 apartments will be available at the end of August. Further batches will be released at a rate of about 40 a month, with the final installment to come to market in December. All the building’s amenities will be online for the first occupants. The Bolton has its own pool and braai area, an 18-seater cinema, free fibre WiFi, a boardroom, a laundry facility, secure basement parking and biometric access control.
