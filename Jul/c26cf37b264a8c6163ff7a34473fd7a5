The retail price of petrol in South Africa will rise by more than 1.5% from July 4, while the price of wholesale diesel will rise by 1.8%, the Energy Department said on Sunday. The price of petrol will rise by 26c to R16.02 a litre in the commercial hub of Gauteng province, while diesel will also go up by 26c to R14.45 a litre. The Central Energy Fund said the lower crude oil prices after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to increase production had offset a sharp fall in the currency, which last month pushed fuel prices to record highs.
