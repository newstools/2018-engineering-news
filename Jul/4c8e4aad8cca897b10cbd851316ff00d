Power generation technology developer Acwa Power on Sunday inaugurated its 120 MW Khalladi Wind Farm, near Tangiers, in Morocco, which will supply clean power to a number of large industrial companies. The 1.7-billion dirham, or $170-million, wind farm was developed by Acwa in collaboration with ARIF Investment Fund. It is located at Jbel Sendouq – 30 km from Tangiers. Funding was facilitated with equity from Acwa and ARIF, as well as long tenor debt from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in collaboration with the Clean Technology Fund and the Moroccan BMCE Bank of Africa. The plant will produce 370 GWh of energy, while contributing to the reduction of 144 000 t/y of carbon emissions. The Khalladi project will contribute to the country achieving its 2020 target of increasing the renewable energy component of its energy mix to 42%. The country aims to establish 2 000 MW of wind capacity by 2020. “We are proud of having been able to establish in Morocco a solid foundation of seven power plants, which will all be operational by the end of this year.” “With a portfolio valued at more than $3.2-billion, we look forward to participating in the future tenders that will be offered to the private sector for power generation and desalinated water production capacity,” said Acwa chairperson Mohammad Abynayyan.
