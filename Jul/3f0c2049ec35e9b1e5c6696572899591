The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has launched a public awareness campaign to introduce South Africans to a commemorative series of banknotes and a R5 circulation coin which honour the birth centenary of former President Nelson Mandela. The commemorative banknotes and the R5 circulation coin will be in circulation from July 13. “The R10 banknote is inspired by the rolling hills of the Eastern Cape, featuring Madiba’s birthplace, Mvezo, and the R20 banknote features Mandela’s home in Soweto, where he defined his political life alongside other struggle icons,” the SARB said in a statement on Wednesday. The R50 banknote depicts the site where Madiba was captured near Howick following 17 months in hiding. Madiba’s time as a political prisoner on Robben Island, where he was incarcerated for 18 of his 27 years in prison, is depicted on the R100 banknote. Inspiration for the R200 banknote comes from the moment when Madiba greeted the nation for the first time as a Statesman, the statement said.
