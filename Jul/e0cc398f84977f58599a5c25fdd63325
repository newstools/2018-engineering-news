Gautrain employees who are members of the United National Transport Union (UNTU) will embark on a protected strike from July 30. The majority of UNTU members working for the Gautrain voted in favour of a strike at an UNTU mass meeting held in Midrand, on Monday. The mass meeting was held to obtain a mandate from UNTU members after the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration issued the union with a strike certificate last week after a deadlock in wage negotiations could not be resolved. UNTU on Tuesday said Gautrain operator, the Bombela Operating Company, is offering UNTU members an 8.5% salary increase across the board but does not want to pay employees an incentive bonus. Based on the current global economic recession, UNTU is demanding a 10% increase in employees’ basic salary, a R1 600 housing allowance, an R800 transport allowance or staff card use for office workers, as well as R64 for NWTS. Additionally, UNTU is also demanding a 10% increase in the night shift allowance and for employers to contribute 55% of employees’ medical aid contributions. The union is also seeking a R20 000 incentive bonus for all employees. “…UNTU members at the Gautrain have no alternative than to embark on a protected strike to try and force their employer to agree to their demands. It is UNTU’s last resort,” UNTU general secretary Steve Harris said.
