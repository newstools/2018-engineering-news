Tullow Oil has stopped works on its Kenyan oil fields and its trucking operations to move oil to the coast due to security issues, Chief Executive Paul McDade told Reuters on Wednesday. "What you saw locally was the local people, the community... using the trucking operation as a lever really to demonstrate to the national government that the security situation on the ground had to improve," McDade said. "It's not a big issue for us," he added. "We'd expect to be up there working, getting the field back operating again and trucks moving again the near future. But it's important to take the time out so that when we do return... we have a more secure environment."
