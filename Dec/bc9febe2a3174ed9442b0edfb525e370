Eskom on Tuesday said it was implementing load shedding across South Africa as it seeks to manage an electricity shortfall. "As a result of a shortage of capacity due to a number of generating units still out of service due to breakdowns, Eskom will be implementing Stage 2 rotational load shedding from 09:00 and this is likely to continue until 22:00. Our maintenance teams continue to work hard to bring the units back to service," the power utility said in a statement. "Customers are reminded to treat all electrical points as live during load shedding. Eskom would like to sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused." Stage 2 calls for 2,000 MW to be "rotationally load shed nationally" at a given period. "We continue to appeal to residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand," Eskom said.
