The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has partnered with the University of Cape Town (UCT) to host the Research Chair in Financial Stability Studies, which will be chaired by Professor Co-Pierre Georg. The portfolio will be housed within the African Institute of Financial Markets and Risk Management, which is an interdisciplinary research institute within the university’s commerce faculty that focuses on risk management, financial mathematics and financial technology. The decision to establish a chair in financial stability studies at a South African university is aligned with the expansion of the SARB’s price stability mandate to include a financial stability objective and responsibility. South Africa’s academic offering in this area is limited and research on financial stability is still in its infancy compared with monetary policy. Georg will develop an agenda that will produce a stream of research that is relevant for the SARB on managing regulatory complexity, financial interconnectedness, computational models, the regulation of blockchain technologies and crypto assets. The chairperson will be tenable for five years, with the possibility of renewal for a further five-year period. In addition to the chair in financial stability studies at UCT, the SARB also supports a chair in monetary policy at the University of Pretoria, and a chair in journalism at Rhodes University.
