Engineering firm ELB Engineering Services and partner Kymeta Corp have successfully obtained approval from the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) for the sale and distribution of the Kymeta KyWay u7 terminal devices in South Africa. The Icasa green light occurred four months after the duo teamed up, with Kymeta aiming to expand its international sales of electronically-steered, flat-panel satellite terminals for high-throughput mobile communications into Africa. “There is tremendous market demand for high-throughput mobile communications in South Africa and Africa which can be deployed in any moving vehicle, including cars, trains, buses, trucks, boats, heavy-duty industrial equipment and much more,” says ELB intelligent solutions business development manager Caroline Petrich. “ELB can now offer high-throughput antennas and metamaterials-based, flat panel antennas, which provide multicast capabilities without ever slowing down or maxing out on capacity – fully meeting the demands of consumers and industries alike, no matter where they are located in the world.”
