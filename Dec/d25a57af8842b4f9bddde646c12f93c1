Construction group Aveng has appointed a former Murray & Roberts executive to lead the company from February 1, it announced on Thursday. Sean Flanagan will take up the position of CEO on February 1, taking over from interim CEO Eric Diack, who will resume his role as nonexecutive chairperson after a six-month transition period. Diack stepped in to fill a position left vacant when Kobus Verster resigned in September last year. Flanagan, who left Murray & Roberts in 2010 after nearly 20 years with the group, has been serving on the Aveng board since November 2015, which the group said made him an ideal appointment as CEO. “Sean has been intimately involved in various strategic initiatives that have been under way at Aveng over the past year. He is, therefore, already up-to-speed with our strategic imperatives and will advance the process without any delays,” commented Diack. Aveng is undergoing what Flangan calls a “reset and renovation programme” to ensure its long-term sustainability and viability.
