A R45-million project to renovate the neonatal unit at Groote Schuur hospital, in Cape Town, has reached practical completion, the Western Cape government reported on Friday. The project was funded by the Red Cross Hospital Trust and overseen by the Department of Transport and Public Works in partnership with the provincial health department. The neonatal unit was built during the early 1970s and had become too small. The upgraded neonatal unit can accommodate 80 babies, including provision for kangaroo mother care (KMC), which refers to mothers living in the ward and being involved in the daily care of their babies. The wards provide a range of levels of care: the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (20 babies), high care (30 babies), pre-KMC (20 babies) and KMC (10 mothers with babies). The likelihood of neonatal infections has been reduced through larger spacing between incubators and more hand washing facilities. Increased space has made it possible to accommodate more life support equipment and larger high-tech incubators, particularly in the NICU.
