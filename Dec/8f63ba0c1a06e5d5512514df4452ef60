To convert Willow Wood Office Park, in Fourways, Gauteng, to using solar energy, Heartwood Properties has partnered with SolarSaver, which offers a rent-to-own model that does not require any capital outlay, to reduce the building’s footprint and save on electricity costs. All indications are that solar energy is the fastest growing alternative energy industry globally, Heartwood said in a statement this week. Its adoption is already impacting on the way buildings are planned and built. “We realise the potential of solar, and the great relief it will bring to our tenants who won’t have to rely on Eskom’s failing system or be at the mercy of its exorbitant pricing structure. Solar is also friendlier to the environment and, as property developers, we must reconsider the impact we have on nature,” commented Heartwood CEO John Whall. SolarSaver finances rooftop solar installations with a proprietary rent-to-own model, meaning that Heartwood has not had to finance any solar equipment, design or installation and only pays for the electricity it uses from the solar system. Offering considerably cheaper electricity tariffs than Eskom, and tariff increases capped at consumer price index inflation, solar installations mean that commercial building tenants will benefit from reduced electricity bills. SolarSaver also carries out all repairs and maintenance of the system for the duration of the contract term. Live monitoring equipment is included as part of the installation. The fourth and final phase of Willow Wood is set for completion in March 2019.
