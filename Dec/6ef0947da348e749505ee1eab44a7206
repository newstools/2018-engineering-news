Cabinet earlier this week ratified a decision by Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies to designate the Nkomazi Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and to grant an SEZ licence to the Mpumalanga provincial government’s Department of Economic Development and Tourism. The Nkomazi SEZ will be positioned as an “agroprocessing hub” using green energy. It will be supported by mixed services such as warehousing and logistics. This forms part of the Maputo Development Corridor project, which is a major trade corridor that connects Gauteng, Limpopo and Mpumalanga with Maputo, in Mozambique. It comprises, among other things, roads, ports and railways. The SEZ will contribute towards accelerating growth, attracting foreign and domestic direct investment, expanding the manufacturing sector and creating employment in the region.
