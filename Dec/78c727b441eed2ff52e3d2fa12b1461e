China-based Sepco III has requested a further extension on the Strategic Development Agreement with dual-listed Kibo Energy at the Mbeya coal-to-power project, in Tanzania. Kibo on Monday said the request would be considered by Kibo’s board this week. The board will determine the terms which would be acceptable to the company for such an extension, taking into consideration the recent strong interest received by the company from other entities expressing a desire to participate in the development of Kibo’s portfolio of energy projects.
