Shango has been the regional senior partner of PwC Southern Africa since July 2015. He will succeed Hein Boegman, who has held the Africa CEO position since July 2015.

Boegman will work closely with Shango during the transition period to July 2019. Shango commented in a statement issued on Wednesday that the firm’s practice in Africa is about 8 000 members strong, with 400 partners and is a strategically important asset in the global PwC network.
