Transport Minister Dr Blade Nzimande on Thursday unveiled Air Traffic and Navigation Services’ (ATNS’) new three-dimensional (3D) mobile simulator during the commemoration of the annual International Civil Aviation Day, in Mbombela, Mpumalanga. ATNS chairperson Simphiwe Thobela said the 3D mobile simulator is intended to bring the interior of an air traffic services tower and the airport environment into display. “The simulator will enable learners from the remotest parts of our country to apply for our air traffic controller bursary,” he noted. The simulator project will increase the pool of mathematics and science learners that ATNS may attract and train as air traffic controllers.
