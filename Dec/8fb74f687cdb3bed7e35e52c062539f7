Residents of Mpumalanga remain concerned about sewage spillages and wastewater challenges. The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has received complaints about alleged sewage spillages and/or the inadequate treatment of wastewater. If found to be true, this violates the affected communities’ right to an environment that is not harmful to their health and wellbeing, as well as the affected communities’ right to clean water and their right to dignity. The SAHRC has launched a provincial inquiry into sewage spillages and wastewater treatment challenges in the province. Meanwhile, despite claims that the national Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) is not attending to the water pollution issues, DWS spokesperson Sputnik Ratau has told Engineering News Online that the department has provided financial support to municipalities in the province throughout the years, and that it has issued regulatory notices. In Standerton, the DWS has secured a court interdict against the Lekwa municipality that compels the municipality to fulfil its obligation in terms of sewage pollution. Ratau further said that the DWS has been providing financial support for the upgrade of two pumpstations in Standerton, namely Rooikoppen 1 and 2, as well as its associated network. Apart from stating that changes to the conditions can be expected as projects are completed, Ratau could not provide Engineering News Online with a timeline for when improvements could be expected.
