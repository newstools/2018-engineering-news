Dutch company Mammoet is expanding its footprint in Africa with the opening of a new office in Accra, Ghana. The new base in Ghana will increase Mammoet’s offerings of specialist services in engineered heavy lifting and transport to the fast growing West African market, allowing for more localised support and swift mobilisation for its customers. “We have conducted business in West Africa for many decades, providing heavy lift and transport solutions for many long-lasting and reputable clients. Ghana is centrally located in West Africa and, with its flourishing economy and welcoming culture, it’s only logical that this is where we have established our base for Mammoet West Africa,” Mammoet West Africa GM Harmen Tiddens said in a statement issued on Friday. Combined with the company’s presence in Nigeria, Mammoet has considerably increased its footprint in West Africa, with this move ensuring it can better serve its clients in the region, he added. The move aligns with Mammoet’s strategic goal of being closer to customers, says Mammoet Middle East and Africa MD Martijn Kuipers. “We believe in the great economic future of West Africa and, as such, we are positioning for growth, not only for Mammoet but also for our customers in the region.” The official opening of the office was marked with an opening ceremony and an exclusive reception held at the residence of the Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Ghana Ron Strikker. At the opening event, the Ambassador congratulated the Mammoet team and endorsed the Embassy’s support for the new office. Mammoet offers solutions for lifting, transporting, installing and decommissioning large and heavy structures in the petrochemicals, offshore, power and civil industries.
