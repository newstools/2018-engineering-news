Brian Dames, the former CEO of cash-strapped Eskom, has stepped down from the newly appointed task team advising government on actions to resolve the State-owned power company's operational, structural and financial challenges. Dames is the CEO of Patrice Motsepe’s African Rainbow Energy and Power (AREP) and stepped down owing to "perceived conflict of interest relating to the scope of work and terms of reference" of the Eskom sustainability task team, the Presidency said on Wednesday. AREP is focusing on clean energy solutions in Africa, based on renewable energy, hydro, gas and complimentary transmission investments. President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday named the task team, which also comprises Anton Eberhard, Tsakani Mthombeni, Sy Gourrah, Grové Steyn, Frans Baleni, Mick Davis and Busisiwe Vilakazi. The group's duties are to assess the operational, structural and financial viability of Eskom, including key assumptions around life of plant, impact and cost of environment commitments and demand assumptions; review the board’s turnaround strategy; assess the appropriateness of the current Eskom business model and structure; present a view on the current energy trends and the evolution of the global energy context; present a view on the role, positioning and structure of energy utilities and provide proposals;  propose alternative business and financial models appropriate for the South African context; propose how the structure of the electricity industry in South Africa can adapt to evolving changes in this sector, including the harnessing of new technologies. The task team will also have to present proposals to resolve Eskom’s debt burden. The utility’s debt stands at R419-billion, most of which is State guaranteed, but the firm is not selling enough power to cover its costs. It has also fallen behind on plant maintenance, resulting in widespread outages. Ramaphosa has requested the task team to submit their proposals by the end of January.
