The 2017 Green Drop Progress Assessment Tool report will be released once the process of quality assurance has been concluded and the necessary approvals have been received, which is anticipated in June 2019, says Water and Sanitation Minister Gugile Nkwinti. In response to a Parliamentary question by Leonard Basson from the Democratic Alliance, the Minister said the assessment of wastewater treatment works has been completed and will be followed by quality assurance and the writing of the report. Nkwinti said the writing of the 2017 report depends on the appointment and approval of a professional services provider. Meanwhile, the 2016 Blue Drop Progress Assessment Tool report is expected to be completed by the end of January 2019. The 2015 version will be released once the necessary approvals have been received. The 2015 and 2016 reports do not deal with the state of water and sanitation infrastructure but drinking water quality management and associated risks.
