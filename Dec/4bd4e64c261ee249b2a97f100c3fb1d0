The Johannesburg Local Division of the High Court of South Africa has granted an order certifying a class action against Tiger Brands. The class action certification follows a listeriosis outbreak in March at Tiger Brands’ subsidiary Enterprise Foods’ manufacturing facility in Polokwane, which is alleged to have resulted in 200 recorded listeriosis-caused deaths since the outbreak. With certification now complete, applicants will issue a summons to start the class action. The class action will proceed in two stages. The first of which will determine whether or not the packaged goods company is liable. Should any of the classes be successful in the first stage, the class action will proceed to the second stage. Tiger Brands noted in a statement on Monday that only members of the classes who opt-in at the second stage will benefit from the class action against the respondents who are found to be liable.
