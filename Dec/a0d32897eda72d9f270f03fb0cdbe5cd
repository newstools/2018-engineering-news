November inflation ticked up to 5.2%, according to data released by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) on Wednesday. This is up from inflation of 5.1% recorded for October. Analysts from NKC Economics had forecast inflation to come in at 5.2%. RMB Global Markets Research head Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana expected inflation figures to be unchanged at 5.1%, due to "relatively stable" fuel prices. The main contributors to inflation were alcoholic beverages and tobacco which increased to 4.8%, year-on-year, followed by miscellaneous goods and services which increased by 5.5% year-on-year. Retail sales data for October will be released at 13:00. NKC analysts expect sales growth to accelerate to 2.5%, from 0.7% recorded in September. US consumer inflation data will also be released later with expectations that it will decline to 2.2% from 2.5%, given weaker energy prices in November, according to NKC.
