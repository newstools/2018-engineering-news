New-vehicle sales in November declined by 4.6%, to 47 486 units, compared with the same month last year. The newest sales numbers, released on Monday, indicated that November new-passenger car sales decreased by 5.4%, to reach 31 054 units. Sales of new bakkies, minibuses and vans, at 13 695 units, dropped by 6.1%. The truck market delivered some good news. Sales of medium trucks, at 804 units, jumped by 17.5%. Sales of new heavy trucks and buses increased by 16.2%, to 1 933 units. New-vehicle exports improved by 2.5%, to 34 352 units. The current tough economic environment was expected to continue over the medium term, with the recent increase in interest rates and ongoing pressure on consumers’ disposable income tightening the screws further, said the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa in a statement. Under the circumstances, the most positive outcome was for the domestic new vehicle market to stabilise in coming months, the association added. “However, any recovery is likely to be modest.” Top-selling cars, bakkies and vans in November:
