South African clean energy development company DLO Energy Resources Group is investing in a solar farm project in Nigeria’s Kaduna state to power its green industrial zone. DLO MD and founder Linda Mabhena-Olagunju and Kaduna state Governor Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai this week signed a memorandum of understanding to build lower-cost, utility-scale solar-electric generating facilities. The development of a 30 MW solar photovoltaic plant is expected to start next year and will generate enough electricity to supply homes, including customers of major local utility providers. “We are very excited to work on this opportunity with our partners and the Kaduna state government. This project is a resounding opportunity for not only providing power in Kaduna but also fostering inter-African collaboration,” said Mabhena-Olagunju in a statement on Monday. She posited that the transaction serves as a good example of an African solution for African problems, while importantly providing a real opportunity for collaboration between South Africa and Nigeria. “We are equally excited to see this project to fruition and believe there is a real opportunity to put renewable energy on the African map,” she said. “We look forward to this project being built and creating real opportunity for the people of Kaduna state,” indicated Kaduna Power Supply Company MD Dr Abdulkareem Mayere. DLO, a 100% black-women-owned independent power producer, has a portfolio of wind and solar assets in South Africa.
