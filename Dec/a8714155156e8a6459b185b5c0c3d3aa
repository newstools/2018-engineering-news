It is back to the drawing board for the procurement of additional rolling stock for the Gautrain system, after the prequalified bidders’ submissions failed to meet procurement requirements, the Gautrain Management Agency (GMA) said on Tuesday. The three qualified bidders – Bombardier Transport, CRRC E-Loco Supply and Egoli Rail Consortium –submitted proposal supply 12 new four-car trains for Gauteng’s rapid rail network, but none were compliant, GMA spokesperson Dr Barbara Jensen confirmed to Engineering News Online. The final proposals were submitted in October and the evaluation by teams of legal, technical, financial and economic development experts was completed in early December. Jensen said that GMA and the Bombela Concession Company would regroup early in the New Year to consider the way forward. She said that they would consider alternative options for delivering additional capacity for the Gautrain, one of which was to issue a new request for proposals. Bombardier Transport, CCR E-Loco Supply and Egoli Rail Consortium were shortlisted as bidders for the rolling stock procurement project in October 2016. Financial close was targeted for the end of 2017, but GMA previously said that the technical and legal complexities were delaying the announcement of a preferred bidder. The Gautrain system currently operates 96 coaches, with train configurations of either four or eight coaches, depending on time-of-day demand. The acquisition of new trains is aimed at alleviating congestion during the morning and evening peaks.
