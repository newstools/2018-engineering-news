State-owned domestic and regional airline SA Express will introduce a new route between Johannesburg, in Gauteng, and Mthatha, in the Eastern Cape, from December 10. The airline will initially operate a daily flight from OR Tambo International Airport with the intention of increasing frequency early in 2019, subject to demand. SA Express said its new route launch was in line with the airline’s primary mandate to promote trade and tourism by connecting secondary destinations to main airport hubs. This route addition brings SA Express’ route offering to eight local and regional routes. Other routes include Johannesburg to Lubumbashi, in the Democratic Republic of Congo; Walvis Bay, in Namibia; and Bloemfontein, Kimberley and Hoedspruit, in South Africa.
