Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has reappointed Mark Kingon as acting Commissioner of the South African Revenue Service (Sars) for a further 90 days, beginning December 13, or until such date as a new Commissioner for Sars is appointed by the President. Section 7 of the Sars Act empowers the Finance Minister to appoint an acting Commissioner. The President, however, appoints a permanent commissioner. Following the judgement of the High Court’s Gauteng Division of December 11 in Tom Moyane vs President and Others, the Finance Minister will assist the President in immediately beginning the process to appoint a new Commissioner of Sars. An advertisement for this position will be published this week, the Ministry of Finance informed in a statement on Friday. The Minister will subsequently submit a shortlist, and the names for members of an interview panel, for the President’s approval. Following interviews – envisaged to be private in nature – the interview panel will recommend a candidate, or candidates, to the President.
