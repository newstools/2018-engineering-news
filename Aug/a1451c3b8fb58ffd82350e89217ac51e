From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: India-based automotive component manufacturer KLT Automotive and Tubular Products South Africa plans to add 1 000 people to its 900-strong work force in the next eight years. Anine Kilian tells us more. Anine Kilian: KLT has a major contract with the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa for the Ford Ranger, and manufactures chassis frames at its Hammanskraal-based factory for the Ford plant in Silverton, Pretoria. KLT Automotive Group MD Jubin Thakkar said that, to expand its employee base, it was key to acquire specific skill sets in South Africa, which the company has done since KLT opened its factory in 2011. KLT Automotive Group MD Jubin Thakkar Anine Kilian: He added that the company built an in-house welding school to train and develop the people of the area to meet production targets. The plant started with a two-shift operation, with the aim of increasing to a three-shift operation to allow for an increased volume of chassis production, once more people were trained and employed. In December 2011, production had reached its expected optimal speed, and with a then trained work force, daily production targets were set over the two-shift spread for 100 chassis frames a shift. Meanwhile, the company is also aiming to meet the requirements of Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration with the envisioned target of ramping up production volumes even further in the coming months.
