The United National Transport Union (UNTU) has accepted the invitation of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to try and resolve the Gautrain strike that entered its fifth day on Friday. Subsequently, Gautrain has also accepted the invitation, as it is concerned about the potential loss of income of its workers and therefore hopes to find a resolution as quickly as possible. UNTU members went on strike on Monday after wage talks between the union and Gautrain operator, the Bombela Operating Company (BOC), deadlocked at the weekend. The CCMA extended its offer to assist in resolving the dispute, in terms of Section 150 of the Labour Relations Act, which says the CCMA may offer its assistance if it is aware that the resolution of the dispute would be in the public interest. The CCMA have not yet determined a date to start mediation proceedings, since Untu have indicated that it is not able to meet sooner than August 6, and other parties have not responded to the invite. Meanwhile, Gautrain assured that it will review its contingency plans over the weekend of August 4 and 5, and communicate possible enhancements to the current service for Monday by August 5.
