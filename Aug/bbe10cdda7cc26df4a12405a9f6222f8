The Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) has, in partnership with Business Unity South Africa (Busa), launched the Anti-Corruption #ThumaMina pledge campaign. The campaign aims to galvanise the business sector, public servants and society at large to take a firm and visible stand against corruption. “We have acknowledged the extent to which corporates and sections of the business sector have been complicit in acts of corruption. The business sector needs to intensify its efforts to improve governance frameworks and strengthen actions that improve the prevention, detection and punishment of corruption,” Busa CEO Tanya Cohen said in a statement. Each of the nonexecutive directors of Busa vowed to be responsible and honest citizens and neither pay nor take bribes. They promised to obey the law and encourage others around them to do the same. "Government is determined to fight against the scourge of corruption in the public and private sector. In the spirit of #ThumaMina we call on all public servants to lead the way in fighting corruption, especially in government institutions,” GCIS acting director Phumla Williams noted.
