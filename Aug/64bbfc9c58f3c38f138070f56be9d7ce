Trade union Solidarity has reached common ground with steel giant ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA) and has signed a wage agreement that is “favourable to all parties”. This follows after the union on July 13 referred its dispute with AMSA to the Metal and Engineering Industries Bargaining Council as negotiations had yielded no results after rounds of negotiations. Solidarity metal and engineering deputy general secretary Marius Croucamp said in a statement on Tuesday that the latest offer involves a three-year wage agreement with a 7% increase in respect of the medical contribution and a 7% increase in wages for employees in the H and I grades, and a 7.5% increase for employees in the J and K grades for year one. In years two and three, a 7% increase will apply for all grades and in respect of all allowances. The wage increase and allowance increase will be backdated to April 1 this year. Meanwhile, another trade union is still in a dispute with AMSA, and further changes are possible. Should the other union secure a better offer, it will also be applicable to Solidarity’s members.
