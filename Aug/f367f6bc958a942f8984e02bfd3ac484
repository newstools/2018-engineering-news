Engineering and technology group SENER, together with Acciona Industrial, have achieved a milestone with the start of the salt melting process at the Kathu Solar Park concentrated solar power (CSP) plant. The molten salt will be used to store heat from the solar field that can later be recovered to produce steam and generate electricity in the absence of solar radiation, extending the operational capacity of the plant after sunset and during cloudy weather. The molten salt storage system allows for four-and-a-half hours of thermal energy storage. The plant uses SENERtrough-2 collectors â€“ a parabolic trough technology, which enables power supply during sunny periods as needed to satisfy the peak of demand, without the considerable expense of battery storage. The joint venture between SENER and Acciona Industrial was appointed by the Engie-led consortium to provide engineering, procurement and construction services for the project. The project is due for completion within the next few months.
