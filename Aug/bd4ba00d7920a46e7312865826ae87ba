JSE-listed information and communications technology service provider Altron on Thursday unveiled a new brand aimed at ensuring the company goes to market under a single identity. “Our new brand brings with it a new culture of how we do business,” said Altron CE Mteto Nyati. “Part of this is our renewed commitment to being a partner to our customers throughout their digital transformation journeys and we want our customers to experience us as trusted advisers,” he added. Altron marketing and investor relations group executive Zipporah Maubane says the group is removing the complexity customers experience when engaging with the various businesses within the group. “A single brand will improve the customer experience, providing them with a seamless process when procuring our end-to-end holistic solutions,” she commented. Maubane adds that the new brand is part of building Altron’s heritage, and demonstrates a stronger emphasis on technology. “It is simple, stands strong, and is easily recognisable and modern without any logo device,” she concluded. Altron will embark on an above-the-line marketing campaign encompassing different channels from August 5.
