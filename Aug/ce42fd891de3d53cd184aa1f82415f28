The Western Cape province's department of transport and public works (DTPW) said on Friday it had started periodic maintenance on the R341 road between De Rust and Uniondale, and that the R29 million project was expected to be complete by March. The road, last refurbished in 1995, provides access to the local farming community and to travellers between Uniondale and De Rust as well as Oudtshoorn. The road was last refurbished in 1995, and 22Â km will be resealed in the project while major intersections will be upgraded and new drains installed at various locations. The department said half-width construction, involving the closure of one lane, would take place in sections, with stop/ go controls to manage the flow of traffic. It warned motorists to expect a 15-minute delay. During the course of this project, R7.4-million would be spent on targeted enterprises, and 11 750 person-days of work would be created for residents of the Eden district municipality area, added the department. "DTPW is committed to creating short-term expanded public works programme employment and skills training opportunities," it said. "The high-quality road infrastructure that DTPW provides is an important component of a safe and effective transport system, and an enabler of economic and social development in the Western Cape."
