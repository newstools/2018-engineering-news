The biennial Mint Directors Conference (MDC) will return to South African shores in 2020, says South African Reserve Bank (SARB) subsidiary, the South African (SA) Mint. The event, which is expected to attract more than 300 guests, will be held in both Cape Town and Pretoria, in April 2020. Established in 1962, in Switzerland, the international conference will see mint directors, coin manufacturers, retailers and other stakeholders discuss matters of common interest regarding technology, markets, social contribution, as well as global financials affecting the currency industry. One of the highlights of the MDC is the awarding and recognition of mints’ designs in coin making and coin packaging. This year, the SA Mint was recognised for its packaging designs, and won four awards in this category. “The conference is a fantastic opportunity for the SA Mint to showcase its innovation and manufacturing capabilities and promote the country. The MDC 2020 will add further to our reputation as a world-class producer of circulation and commemorative coins. It is the premier event for attracting international interest,” says SA Mint MD Tumi Tsehlo. He adds that the SA Mint is confident that, in 2020, the minting industry will have an enjoyable experience and that SA Mint looks forward to showcasing the developments of the country’s young democracy. Additionally, the MDC 2020 in South Africa promises to be the most environment-friendly MDC conference yet. To achieve this, the SA Mint has appointed global currency conference company Reconnaissance International to manage the event, which will be paperless and will use digital technology at every touchpoint.
