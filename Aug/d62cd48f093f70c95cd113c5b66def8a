The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) will close a section of the M2 Karsene bridge on August 25 and 26, owing to the reduced structural integrity of the concrete elements. While undertaking continuous monitoring at the M2 Karsene bridge, JRA engineers realised that parts of the support structure have moved vertically and horizontally, affecting the structural stability of the bridge. About 200 m of the Karsene section of the bridge will be closed off to traffic and traffic from the east-bound lanes will be diverted onto the west-bound lane to allow for traffic to flow in both directions. JRA engineers will continue to monitor the M2 Selby bridge, which is still open to the public. The M2 Selby and Karsene bridgesâ€™ total repair and rehabilitation works will start from the second week of October and should take about 12 months to complete. The JRA reported earlier this week that only about 6% of the 902 bridges managed by the city are considered to be in a good condition.
