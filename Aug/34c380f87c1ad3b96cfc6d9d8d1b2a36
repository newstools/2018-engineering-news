The National Transport Movement (NTM) on Wednesday welcomed the announcement of Siza Mzimela as acting chief executive of beleaguered airline, SA Express (SAX). In a statement, NTM described Mzimela's appointment as an "excellent choice". "Siza is well respected in the aviation sector. Her appointment could not come at a better time as SA Express plans to resume its flight schedules in the next few weeks following the reinstatement of its Air Operatorâ€™s Certificate," NTM said in a staement. The union also welcomed the transfer of the administration of South African Airways (SAA) from National Treasury to the department of public enterprises. "In both cases of SAX and SAA, we hope the management of the airlines will consult with our union on plans to financially stabilise the two carriers," NTM said. "We will work hard to provide input to how the airlines can stop the financial losses, lift staff morale and play their part in the economic development of our country."
