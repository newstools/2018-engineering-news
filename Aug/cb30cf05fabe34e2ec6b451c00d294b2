State-owned defence industrial group Denel has welcomed the report by the Armaments Corporation of South Africa (Armscor) on the Denel Land Systems (DLS) division’s employment equity compliance status on the flagship Hoefyster project. The Hoefyster employment equity compliance assessment report was commissioned by the previous management of DLS and is, therefore, of interest to the current management team. The report provides analysis of the state of employment equity within the division and offers recommendations. Armscor is the arms procurement agency for the Department of Defence. “The report points out important areas where DLS needs to improve in relation to the appointment and promotion of black South Africans in the programme,” said DLS CEO Ismail Dockrat. Accelerated transformation with regard to employment equity is one of the key priorities identified by the new board and executive management. The report will be used as a baseline by DLS management to devise an action plan, which should address the identified findings and recommendations. “Despite significant progress in transforming the company, there are gaps, but Denel remains committed to ensuring transformation in terms of demographics and the business for long-term growth and sustainability,” noted Dockrat. DLS is undergoing a turnaround process with the primary mandate being implementation of a well-thought-through turnaround strategy that has defined goals to set DLS on a growth trajectory. Denel will make new appointments to executive positions soon, which will bring stability to the organisation and enable a focus on core business delivery in programmes such as Hoefyster. Hoefyster is a multibillion-rand project undertaken by DLS to deliver new-generation infantry combat vehicles to the South African National Defence Force.
