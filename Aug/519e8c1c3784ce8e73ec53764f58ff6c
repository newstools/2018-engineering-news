Black, women-owned company South African Marine Fuels (SAMF) has started providing bunkering services in Algoa Bay, in the Eastern Cape, making the port a leading bunker and ship repair service provider to a wider market and the only licensed offshore bunkering operation in South Africa. SAMF MD Siyamthanda Maya said since its operations started, the project has experienced significant progress and has managed to amass an experienced crew, providing transport, lodging, vessel supplies and technical services. “Currently we have three barges, which are charted and operated by SAMF. This is important because when operations are managed and directed locally this ensures that the industry and expertise are fully introduced to the country. “This industry, over the past three years, has been breeding positive results, which promote sustainable growth; this was also made possible through the active contribution of associated services happening around bunkering, like the increase in ship chandlers as well as shipping agencies, which have increased employment, directly adding value to this province,” she stated.
