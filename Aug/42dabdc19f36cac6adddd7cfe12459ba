Bridgestone South Africa will move into its new head office, located in the growing Waterfall City commercial node between Johannesburg and Pretoria, in February next year. The tyre manufacturer’s new headquarters will occupy 4 800 m2 and accommodate a staff complement of more than 200. “This is truly an exciting time for us and it commemorates a significant transformation for the company, employees, customers and partners,” says Bridgestone South Africa CEO Gavin Young. “The construction of new offices is in line with our revised strategy. We are not in the property business, therefore, we took the decision to sell our property space in Isando and use that capital to invest in business growth and innovation. “We wish to place a stronger focus on what is important to our customers, which is providing the right solutions to address their needs. This capital will help us improve efficiencies and operations within the business. “The employee work space is also critical in our consideration on this new offices’ construction,” adds Young. “Employees need a space that provides comfort and great ambience, as well as an environment that inspires innovative and creative thinking. “We believe the new office design will enhance staff collaboration and engagement and move away from hierarchical structure to improve productivity. We are positioned to be an employer of choice in the industry and it is only fitting that we create the state of the art and modern office environment to appeal to new recruits going forward.” “We are honoured that Bridgestone has entrusted Abland to develop their new offices as part of our Waterfall Precinct development, which is set to become one of the largest motor nodes in South Africa,” notes Abland marketing and leasing director Grant Silverman. Abland says the site will be one of the largest motoring cities in Gauteng and home to flagship car brands such as BMW, among others.
