The South African Revenue Service (Sars) will be re-establishing the Large Business Unit and the Illicit Economy Team. The decision, which was made by Sars acting commissioner Mark Kingon and the Sars executive committee, was based on the “pivotal role that these units play in enabling Sars to provide effective and efficient service to large corporate taxpayers, and in fighting illicit trade in the country,” the revenue service said in a statement. Chief officer for governance, international relations, strategy and communications Hlengani Mathebula has been tasked with leading the process to re-establish the Large Business Unit, while the re-establishment of the Illicit Economy Team will be led by chief officer for enforcement Mogola Mokola. The involvement of the two senior Sars officials is crucial to ensuring the new units are not “merely a rehash of the previous units, but rather to ensure that the units will be responsive to the challenges currently being faced by Sars”. Meanwhile, the revenue service has already put together a multidisciplinary team to work out the details and logistics of the highly-focused and disciplined units. Among of the team members are officials who worked in the disbanded units and would make valuable contributions to the formation of the new units, according to the revenue service, which added that the teams have already begun with their work. “It is envisaged that progress reports will be presented to the Sars executive committee by the end of [the month].”
