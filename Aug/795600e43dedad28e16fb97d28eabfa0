JSE-listed Sea Harvest expects to report a 0% to 3% increase in its headline earnings for the six months ended June 30, to between R110.7-million and R114-million, after absorbing transaction costs related to its acquisition of Viking Fishing. Earnings per share (EPS) for the six months are, however, expected to be 25% to 31% lower year-on-year at between 46c and 50c. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) are expected to be 13% to 20% lower year-on-year at between 45c and 49c. Sea Harvest attributes the decrease in EPS and HEPS mainly to an increase in the weighted average number of shares in issue. The company expects to release its interim results on or about August 28.
