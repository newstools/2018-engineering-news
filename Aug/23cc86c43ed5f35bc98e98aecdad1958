Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane confirmed on Thursday that Cabinet has approved the publication of the updated Integrated Resources Plan (IRP) and that it will be published in the Government Gazette on August 27. Briefing media on the outcomes of the Cabinet meeting held on Wednesday, she noted that the finalisation of the IRP would provide the necessary certainty to industry players, as well as consumers, regarding the security of electricity supply in the medium to long term. “Energy infrastructure is a critical component that underpins economic activity and growth across the country, it needs to be robust and extensive enough to meet industrial, commercial and household needs,” she said. Energy Minister Jeff Radebe is expected to engage the National Economic Development and Labour Council executive committee about the draft report on Friday, ahead of its publication in the gazette.
