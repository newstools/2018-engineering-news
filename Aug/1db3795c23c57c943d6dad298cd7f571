The Competition Tribunal has approved the merger of Zaad Holdings and Hygrotech Properties, which are both involved in the breeding, producing, processing and distribution of agricultural seeds. Zaad, which will be the controlling company, specialises in forage seeds, and is also involved in the production and distribution of hard agrochemicals and fertilisers. Hygrotech specialises in vegetable seed production, processing and distribution; seed breeding and production; and soft agrochemicals and fertilisers. Zaad, in turn, is controlled by Zeder Investments, which has diversified investments across the agribusiness spectrum.
