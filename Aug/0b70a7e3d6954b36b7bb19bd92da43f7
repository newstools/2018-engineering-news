Aviation company ExecuJet, which is part of the Luxaviation group, will, in October, become the first business aviation company to operate and manage a Pilatus PC-24 Super Versatile Jet in Africa. With the aircraft to be based at the Cape Town International Airport, ExecuJet will be responsible for its day-to-day management and operations on behalf of the aircraft owner. The PC-24, developed by Swiss original-equipment manufacturer Pilatus, has been dubbed the “super versatile jet” owing to its flexibility and ability to operate in and out of very short and unpaved runways. The PC-24 will also be available for charter and offers clients the latest in in-flight entertainment and connectivity. With six passengers, departing Cape Town, the aircraft can reach Angola, Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique. Flying from ExecuJet’s fixed-base operater at Lanseria International Airport, in Johannesburg, passengers can reach the Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Kenya and Mauritius, according to Pilatus. “Africa is the perfect environment for the PC-24, with its testing terrain and challenging runways, and we are honoured to be the first business aviation operator to manage the aircraft in the region,” said ExecuJet VP Gavin Kiggen. He added that ExecuJet looks forward to welcoming the aircraft when it arrives at the Cape Town facility in October.
