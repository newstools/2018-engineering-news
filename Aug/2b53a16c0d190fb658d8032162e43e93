Ivor Evans was, on Wednesday, awarded the first ever Consulting Engineers South Africa (CESA) Lifetime Industry Achievement Award posthumously at the 2018 CESA Aon Engineering Excellence awards on Wednesday. This year close to 50 submissions were received and in celebration of Nelson Mandela’s Centenary year, CESA expanded the award’s categories to include the Lifetime Industry Achievement Award, a discretionary award to recognise an individual who has contributed significantly to the development and promotion of the consulting engineering industry in South Africa during their lifetime.  “It was befitting that we included this new category in the centenary year of one of the greatest legends of all time, Nelson Mandela. Engineers create legacies. Each time you change the landscape, you change history. Each time you plan, design, build, maintain and rehabilitate, you are creating a legacy for the next generation,” CESA CEO Chris Campbell said in a statement on Thursday.
