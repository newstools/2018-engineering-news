Two solar plants, Ejuva One and Ejuva Two, were opened in Gobabis, Namibia, by Deputy Minister of Mines and Energy Kornelia Shilunga, on Thursday. She said Ejuva will help to diversify Namibia’s energy mix, increase generation capacity and reduce carbon emissions. “We are particularly pleased about the strong local component and the positive impact during construction on local job creation and skills development.” The plants, with a total build cost of N$250-million, or $21-million, are located side by side and were built and managed as one project. The plant will feed an estimated 25.8 GWh/y into Namibia’s national grid and is backed by a 25-year power purchase agreement with utility Nampower. The project is among the 14 renewable energy projects commissioned under the interim Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff programme, which was initiated by the Ministry of Mines and Energy and the Electricity Control Board, to establish independent power producers in Namibia. Local equity partners own 34% of the two plants, Consolidated Infrastructure Group subsidiary CIGenCo 49% and asset manager Mergence Unlisted Investment Managers 17%.
