Sandile Zungu has been elected the new president of the Black Business Council (BBC). He succeeds Danisa Baloyi, whose term has come to an end. “We are excited and positive that the new leadership will usher a new era and give hope to the black business in general during these trying times and era of high unemployment, slow economic growth, lack of progress with economic transformation and global protectionism,” BBC CEO Kganki Matabane said in a statement on Wednesday.
