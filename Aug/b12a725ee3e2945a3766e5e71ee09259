Metal packaging industry body MetPac-SA CEO Kishan Singh has been awarded the designation “certified packaging professional” (CCP) by the US-based International Institute of Packaging Professionals (IoPP). Singh, who is a global ambassador of the World Packaging Organisation and a national education officer of the Institute of Packaging South Africa, is the first packaging expert in South Africa to receive the designation. IoPP has, since 1972, been awarding the designation to individuals who have years of experience, in-depth packaging knowledge and commitment to the global packaging industry. Singh explained that the CPP designation has become the leading mark of excellence internationally and a must-have recognition of industry proficiency and achievement for packaging professionals. The CPP designation is based on current skills and expertise, and candidates are required to be re-certified every three years as part of a continuous professional development system. CPP candidates are expected to demonstrate either their command of applied packaging technology by successfully completing a narrative exam, or submit a detailed resume of activities in which they document their past six years of experience and active participation in the local and global packaging industry.
