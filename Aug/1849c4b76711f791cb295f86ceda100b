Dlamini joined VWSA in 2008 as Volkswagen’s product PR manager, followed by a stint as personal assistant to VWSA chairperson and MD Thomas Schaefer. Gennrich, who officially retired from Volkswagen after 38 years of service in March, has been overseeing the transition on a contractual basis. He will continue to serve the company as a consultant until the end of the year, but will relinquish his operational responsibilities as of September 1. “We would like to thank Matt for his loyal service, dedication and contribution to the company in his many different roles over the years. Matt’s knowledge and passion for the automotive industry has been a great benefit to the company and he will be missed.” says Schaefer.
