The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) Commission will host its first Women Empowerment Conference, in Pretoria, on August 24. The conference, held under the theme ‘Advancing Women Economic Empowerment through the BBBEE Act’, will be addressed by Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies, Trade and Industry Portfolio Committee chairperson Joan Fubbs and Tourism Deputy Minister Elizabeth Thabethe. The speakers will discuss opportunities available to black women, the eradication of barriers to economic participation and increasing women participation on boards and ownership structures of companies and government entities. The conference aims to raise awareness during Women’s Month and will focus on ways to eradicate barriers but also how to take advantage of the opportunities provided in the BBBEE Act to develop women and grow women-owned businesses. The target audience for the conference includes women organisations, women-owned businesses, women in government, nongovernmental organisations, associations, tertiary and Grade 12 students, as well as people with disabilities and women at large, including the youth. These groups have been identified as people who are lagging behind in accessing economic opportunities.
