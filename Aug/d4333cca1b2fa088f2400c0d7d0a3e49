Ethiopian Airlines has signed joint venture agreements and business partnerships with at least 14 countries on the continent as part of its Vision 2025 growth plan, under which the carrier hopes to become “the leading aviation group in Africa”, the East African reported. From Zambia and Malawi in the South, Chad and soon the Democratic Republic of Congo in Central Africa and Togo, with a likelihood of Nigeria and Ghana in the West, the carrier is seeking to dominate the continent’s aviation space.
