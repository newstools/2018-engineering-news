As part of the City of Joburg’s Rea Vaya bus rapid transit (BRT) project along the Louis Botha development corridor, the Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA) is constructing the Watt interchange, in Wynberg. The works for the interchange include the demolition of the existing bridge and the interchange at Watt street. The demolition work will start on August 6 and is expected to take between 10 and 12 working days to complete. The demolition process will have no impact on motorists, assured JDA CEO Christo Botes; however, businesses near the bridge may feel the vibrations and hear the noise from the machines that are breaking the concrete. Watt interchange forms part of the BRT’s Phase 1C, which includes the Section 8 trunk route from Sandton to Alexandra along Rivonia and Catherine drives, and the Section 15 trunk route from Parktown to Alexandra along Louis Botha avenue.
