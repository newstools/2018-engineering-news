The Energy Intensive User Group (EIUG) of Southern Africa is concerned about the continuing industrial conflict at State-owned Eskom, it said in a statement on Wednesday. It called on the power utility and its unions to find a way to end the impasse, and to “show responsibility in respect of energy supply to the country”. The EIUG represents energy-intensive users who currently account for about 40% of electrical energy consumed in South Africa. “South Africa can ill afford ongoing industrial unrest at Eskom. Firstly, the economy needs the lights to stay on and secondly, the current conflict is not conducive to investment,” EIUG CEO Xolani Mbanga lamented, emphasising the importance of certainty and security of electricity supply for all electricity users in the country. Eskom has this week, again, had to resort to load-shedding, as its operations were disrupted by striking employees.
