The explosion of an electrical transformer at Rand Waterâ€™s Eikenhof pumping station, in Johannesburg South, will affect water supply to consumers in parts of the West Rand, as well as Rustenburg in the North West province. The transformer, which is part of the electricity facility supplying power to the Eikenhof pumping station, is owned by Johannesburg City Power. Technicians from Rand Water and City Power are currently on site at the pumping station. More information is expected in the following hours.
