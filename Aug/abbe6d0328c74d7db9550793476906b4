From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Veolia Water Technologies South Africa has opened a chemical production facility in Pomona, Kempton Park that is set to export to Veolia’s clients throughout Africa, owing to its competitive costs of production compared with other Veolia chemical production facilities. Schalk Burger has the story. Schalk Burger: The 6 600 m2 blending facility conforms to international chemical safety and handling best practices, has an onsite laboratory for testing and quality control and does not discharge any liquid waste, instead recycling its industrial water. The facility produces more than 40 chemicals, which are part of Veolia’s Hydrex range of water chemicals. All conform to international standards and can be supplied throughout the company’s global footprint. The facility produces about 500 tons a month of water treatment chemicals, but can increase production when needed. Veolia South Africa business development manager Chris Braybrooke highlights some of the features of the new facility.
