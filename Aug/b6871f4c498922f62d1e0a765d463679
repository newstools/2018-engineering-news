BACKGROUND
In February 2009, the commission initiated a complaint into alleged collusive conduct in the construction of the 2010 FIFA World Cup stadia. The investigation considered alleged prohibited practices relating to collusive conduct in the construction of stadiums for the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup against Group Five, Grinaker-LTA, Basil Read, WBHO Construction, Murray & Roberts, Stefanutti Stocks, Interbeton Abu Dhabi and Bouygues Construction SA. Following applications for immunity, the commission in September 2009 initiated a complaint with regard to price fixing, market allocation and collusive tendering conduct in respect of construction projects. The same year, Group Five applied for leniency in respect of 61 prescribed and nonprescribed prohibited practices. In February 2011, the commission invited companies to take part in the Construction Fast Track Settlement process. Fifteen construction companies paid settlements amounting to just over R1.4-billion.
