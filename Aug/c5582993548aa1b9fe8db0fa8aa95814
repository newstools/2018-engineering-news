South Africa's mainly white Solidarity union has given Sasol a 48-hour notice to strike over the energy giant's plan to launch a share ownership scheme exclusively for black staff, the union said on Tuesday. "This type of crude racial exclusion cannot be tolerated any longer. These white workers are also valuable," Solidarity CE Dirk Hermann said in a statement. Under black economic empowerment rules, South African companies are required to meet quotas on black ownership, employment and procurement as part of a drive to reverse decades of exclusion under apartheid.
