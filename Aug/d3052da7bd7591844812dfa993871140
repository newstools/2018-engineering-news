Waste manager Pikitup has suspended services in certain areas following the burning and stoning of its trucks in Soweto, on Friday, and continued threats of violence towards staff members this week. The affected depots include Central Camp and Zondi, where protestors are currently most active, in wanting to be insourced despite not meeting set criteria during the verification process. Service areas affected include Diepkloof, Orlando East, Orlando West, Dube, Meadowlands, Noordgesig, Pennyville, Klipspruit, Motsoaledi, Pimville, Kliptown, Senaone, Dlamini, Moroka, Mfolo South, Mfolo North, Mfolo Central, Protea Glen, Zondi, Jabavu, Central Western Jabavu, Jabulani, Dobsonville, Protea Glenridge, Chiawelo, Emdeni, Phiri, Mapetla, Slovoville, Greenvillage, Longtill, Sgodiphola and Lefhureng. Pikitup MD Lungile Dhlamini said it would be irresponsible for depot managers to allow staff members to work under such conditions as their safety could not be guaranteed. He added that Pikitup only implements political decisions and board resolutions, and it not capable of making policy; therefore, objections to the insourcing project should be directed to the mayor, speaker and members of mayoral committee offices. Pikitup will issue further communication following situational improvement and attend to refuse collection backlogs once the conflict subsides.
