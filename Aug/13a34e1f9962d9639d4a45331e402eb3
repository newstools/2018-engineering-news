From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Construction industry service and technology provider Hilti South Africa is offering two innovative technologies – the HIT-Z rod and advanced on-site testing – to ensure safety and reliability for chemical fasteners. Tasneem Bulbulia tells us more. Tasneem Bulbulia: Hilti South Africa head of engineering Christiaan Davel tells Engineering News that Hilti developed these two technologies in response to specific client needs, to help overcome challenges posed by chemical fasteners. Davel explains that while chemical fasteners boast a high load capacity and bond strength, they are sensitive to correct installation. During installation of chemical fasteners, it is vital that holes drilled into base materials be cleaned thoroughly. However, this required level of quality control is not always possible or implemented. Therefore, Hilti developed the HIT-Z rod to overcome this. Hilti South Africa head of engineering Christiaan Davel: Hilti field engineer Ebert Mulder: Tasneem Bulbulia: For this new service, Hilti undertakes testing with a device using an electric gauge, which is connected to a phone via Bluetooth. The data gleaned is uploaded to a global server using Hilti’s phone app. The data is analysed and returned to engineers in terms of design consistencies in accordance with global testing standards, which the engineers can then use to design solutions. Hilti field engineer Ebert Mulder: Sashnee Moodley: That’s Creamer Media’s Real Economy Report. Join us again next week for more news and insight into South Africa’s real economy.
