The Railway Safety Regulator (RSR) on Wednesday said the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) was operating trains without a valid safety permit. PRASA’s safety permit, which was previously issued with special conditions, expired at midnight on July 31, and the RSR has taken the decision not to issue a permit until it is satisfied that PRASA’s planned interventions address the current safety concerns. “The RSR is of the opinion that PRASA cannot demonstrate to the regulator that it has the ability, commitment and resources to properly assess and effectively control the risks to assets and safety of its customers, staff, contractors, visitors and others who may be affected by its railway operations,” the RSR said in a statement on Wednesday.
