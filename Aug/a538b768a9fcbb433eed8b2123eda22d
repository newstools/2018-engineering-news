JSE-listed diversified real estate investment trust (Reit) Redefine Properties and VDMV Property Group on Friday officially opened the newly improved Cilmor road bridge over the R300. The bridge, which was completed in August, was built at a cost of R27-million and is expected to further improve access to Brackengate 2 – a logistics and light industrial business park located adjacent to the Shoprite Cilmor distribution centre, in Brackenfell South, Cape Town.
 
With the bridge now open, Brackengate 2 will enjoy improved road access from the N1 and N2, via La Belle street.
 
Importantly, the new bridge connects Stikland and Brackengate on either side of the R300 and assists with easing the traffic pressure on the R300 itself. The bridge will also alleviate traffic on internal roads within the Stikland and Brackengate precincts. “The build forms part of planned upgrades and construction to accommodate future growth in the area. It is also another step in providing the required road infrastructure, alternate access points to and from Stikland and Brackengate to surrounding road networks.
 
“In addition to its phenomenal location and easy access points, Brackengate 2 offers tenants unmatched visibility from the R300 freeway as well as Bottelary road and lies well outside the high-congestion zones of Montague Gardens and Epping Industria,” said Redefine Properties coastal GM Grant Elliott.
 
The first warehousing facilities within Brackengate 2 were completed during the first half of this year. The completion of Planet Fitness and Brights Hardware are expected during end 2018 and early 2019, respectively.
