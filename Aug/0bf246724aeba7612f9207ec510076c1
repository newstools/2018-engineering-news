State-owned Denel expects its participation in the upcoming Africa Aerospace and Defence (AAD) exhibition to be a “confident” step towards turning the business around and rebuilding Denel, says acting CEO Michael Kgobe. He adds that the group’s participation should also be seen as a step in “rebuilding the confidence of the broader stakeholder environment following a difficult period of lapses in governance that led to reputation damage and liquidity challenges”. Kgobe says the event will be an important platform to communicate some of the company’s achievements and plans going forward. “Although our exhibition footprint will be reduced this year, we are determined to showcase the quality technologies that have become synonymous with the Denel brand in different markets.” The AAD exhibition is a biennial event that is hosted at the Waterkloof Air Force Base. This year’s exhibition will take place from September 19 to 23.
