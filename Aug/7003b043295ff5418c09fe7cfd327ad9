JSE-listed and UK-based multi-let industrial property investor Stenprop has acquired the Lombard Centre industrial estate, in Aberdeen, from Mayfair Capital for £3.25-million. The Lombard Centre is a modern estate with ten units, one of which is vacant. “We have acquired another high-quality, purpose-built estate as part of our transition into a focused multi-let industrial company. The Lombard Centre is located adjacent to Aberdeen's international airport and heliport in a prime industrial area, with healthy industrial demand and limited supply. “Many of the tenants are long standing on the estate and we look forward to working with them,” comments Stenprop executive property director Julian Carey.
