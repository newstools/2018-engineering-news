Garth Strachan, previously the Department of Trade and Industry’s deputy director-general of the Industrial Development division, has been appointed acting CEO of the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS). This follows the resignation, effective August 1, of suspended former SABS CEO Dr Boni Mehlomakulu. Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies last month appointed three DTI officials, including Strachan, as co-administrators of the SABS and tasked them with undertaking a diagnostic analysis and developing a “turnaround strategy” to improve operations at the SABS. This followed the Minister’s decision, in June, to dissolve the SABS board of directors.
