JSE-listed services, trading and distribution company Bidvest expects its earnings per share (EPS) for the year ended June 30 to be between 19% and 22% lower at between R1.11 and R1.15 apiece, compared with R1.43 apiece in the prior year. The lower EPS can be attributed to a contraction in the share prices of the company’s associates, Adcock Ingram and Comair, compared with material share price increases in the prior year. Normalised headline earnings per share (HEPS) are expected to be between R1.23 and R1.27 apiece, which is between 11% and 14% higher than the R1.11 reported in the prior year. HEPS are expected to be between R1.21 and R1.24, which is between 10% and 12% higher than the R1.10 in the prior year. Bidvest’s results will be released on or around September 3.
