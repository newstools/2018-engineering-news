Shares in MTN Group plunged as much as 19% early on Thursday, a day after Nigeria ordered the South African telecoms group and its bankers to return $8.1-billion. Nigeria's central bank said the funds had been illegally moved abroad. MTN denies the allegations. At 0713 GMT, the stock was down 14% at R92.12, recouping some of the losses after falling to a low of R86.99.
