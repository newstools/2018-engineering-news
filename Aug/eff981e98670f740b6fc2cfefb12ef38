New Partnership for Africa’s Development Business Foundation (NBF) Africa infrastructure desk programme manager Peter Varndell will assume the role of acting CEO of the organisation, following Lynette Chen’s resignation in June. NBF rail project manager Kudzanayi Bangure has assumed the role of NBF infrastructure desk programme manager. NBF chairperson Geoff Rothschild said in a statement on Friday that Chen gave exemplary service to NBF for 14 years, building the organisation with an effective team, while advocating for socioeconomic transformation for the benefit of the African continent. He added that Varndell has led the Africa infrastructure desk team with distinction, in pursuit of the realisation of the NSC Rail project and is readily available to continue developing mutually beneficial relationships with stakeholders.
