Workers union will on Monday present new wage proposals to their members in order to obtain a mandate and end the two-week strike at Gautrain following a marathon meeting with Bombela Operating Company. More than 90% of Gautrain workers downed tools on July 30, demanding a 10% basic salary hike, R1 600 a month housing allowance, R20 000 a year unconditional bonus per employee, an increase in night work transport subsidy of R64 per night shift and 50% medical aid contribution. As a result, the Gautrain had to reduce train service during off-peak hours and on weekends, as well as its bus service. In the meeting on Sunday, the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), which was roped in to mediate the talks, tabled a new offer to the United National Transport Union (Untu). If workers accept the offer at a mass meeting on Monday morning, the strike will end. Untu, together with the Federation of Unions of South Africa, will thereafter brief the media on the mandate given by the workers.
