South Africa's economic growth this year will be "much lower" than initial expectations, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) said in a presentation to Parliament on Wednesday, calling any recovery "weak and choppy". The SARB added that fixed investment was not expected to pick up meaningfully this year, while inflation risks remained on the upside.
