Waste manager Pikitup has suspended services in Orange Farm, Ivory Park and Midrand owing to continued threats of violence towards staff members and blocked access gates at some of Pikitupâ€™s depots. Earlier this week, it suspended services in Soweto, amid protests by people wanting to be insourced despite not meeting set criteria during the verification process. Pikitup MD Lungile Dhlamini reiterated that Pikitup only implements political decisions and board resolutions, it does not make policy; therefore, objections to the insourcing project should be directed to the mayor, speaker and members of the mayoral committee.
