The Transnet board has served notice on CEO Siyabonga Gama and two other top senior officials that it intends to place them on precautionary suspension. Chief procurement officer Thamsanqa Jiyana and supply chain manager Lindiwe Mdletshe also received letters on Wednesday. The move comes after reports from attorneys and forensic investigators revealed "various acts of possible misconduct against the three employees" and recommended further investigations be carried out to establish the extent of it, the company said in a statement. The alleged misconduct includes flouting the Public Finance Management Act, Transnet's own procurement policies and the Companies Act.
