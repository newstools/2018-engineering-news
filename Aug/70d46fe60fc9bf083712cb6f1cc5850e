South African power utility, Eskom on Thursday said it has postponed the planned power interruptions to the Emfuleni municipality following a court interdict lodged by a group of local businesses in the greater Vaal area, in Gauteng. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said the businesses have asked for permission from the court to allow them to pay Eskom directly. “Emfuleni municipality, which includes areas such as Vanderbijlpark, Sebokeng, Vereeniging and surrounds, owes Eskom over R600-million,” Phasiwe said on Twitter. Phasiwe said the matter will be heard on August 24. In previous cases, the courts had ruled in favour of the companies, allowing Eskom to directly supply them with electricity and they in turn paying Eskom directly. Municipalities lose out on revenues in the process.
