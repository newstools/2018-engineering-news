The chief executive officer of ARM Cement said on Thursday he planned to leave his post as part of a management shake-up, but would stay on as a board member. "As founder shareholder and entrepreneur, I will be an active Board member and support the incoming CEO and the management team in strengthening stakeholder relationships with suppliers, customers and the Government in all the three East African countries where we operate," Pradeep Paunrana said in a letter to shareholders and ARM staff.
