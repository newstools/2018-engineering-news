More than 2 000 leaders from government, business, science and civil society from around the world will join the World Economic Forum’s (WEF's) annual meeting of the new champions in Tianjin, China, in September. The meeting, taking place on September 18 to 20, will see 111 countries represented and bring together the key decision-makers related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Now in its 12th year, the main objective of Summer Davos is to create a global community to ensure that emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain and the internet of things are used to benefit society and that they remain human-centred. This requires global collaborative efforts to define the necessary principles of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the standards to ensure global interoperability. According to a statement from WEF, the meeting will be strongly outcome-oriented and different from traditional conferences. In addition to the opening plenary and over 20 high-level panel discussions, the programme will feature over 100 working sessions aimed at engaging every participant in specific issues and policies related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The annual meeting of the new champions will be a showcase for China’s rapid achievements in scientific and technological development. It will also provide an opportunity for international leaders and their Chinese colleagues to discuss issues of global importance. “The world economic forum is celebrating 40 years of close cooperation with the People’s Republic of China. I am proud that we can celebrate this special year with a meeting that brings together leaders at the highest level from the government, business and other sectors of society to advance global cooperation, particularly in the field of technology and science,” said Professor Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairperson of the World Economic Forum.
