Liberty Two Degrees (L2D), in partnership with Liberty Group, on Wednesday announced the first solar photovoltaic (PV) installation at the Liberty Midlands Mall, in Pietermaritzburg. This solar PV plant is being commissioned on the roof of the mall’s 22 000 m2 Phase 3 extension, which was launched in March. Installation is set to start in September, with completion scheduled for the first quarter of 2019. The plant will be a grid tied, roof-mounted PV installation comprising 2 900 panels, which will supply around 1 MW of energy to the mall. “Reducing carbon footprints across our retail portfolio is a priority for L2D. The solar PV project for Liberty Midlands Mall will serve as the first initiative of its kind in our portfolio and will act as a benchmark for future solar plant project roll-outs,” commented L2D asset management executive for Liberty Midlands Mall Brian Unsted. He noted that the mall’s solar PV plant aligns with L2D’s strategy of investing in renewable energy for improved efficiency and the management of natural resources for the benefit of the environment. “We have put in place an effective framework to continually improve our environmental impact, an initiative that remains integral to our commitment to improve our operations,” Unsted concluded.
