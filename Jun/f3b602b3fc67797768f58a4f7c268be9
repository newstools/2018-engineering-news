On July 18 – what would have been Nelson Mandela’s centenary – 67 global influencers, business leaders and celebrities will spend the night inside the former maximum-security prison and courtyard on Robben Island, where Mandela spent 18 years, with the aim to raise $67-million. On the same night, an auction will be held for the highest bidder, starting at $25 000 to sleep inside cell number seven, Mandela’s home during his imprisonment. The aim is to raise $67-million through the 67 participants at a pledge of $100 000 each. One of the primary beneficiaries of the 2018 SleepOut Movement is the Qunu Food Securtiy Project, in the Eastern Cape. The CEO SleepOut events from 2015 to 2017, raised over R38-million, involved over 470 business leaders and supported 315 beneficiaries. Speaking at the launch of this year’s event, Pan African Parliament ambassador for food security Dr Brylyne Chitsunge said the plan is to develop a platform for agricultural stakeholders to work with 250 members of the Qunu community on Mandela’s farm, to ensure the development of agriculture and commercial farming within South Africa. “The funds received will determine how many farmers are trained, the amount of product supplied and the number of bursaries that can be awarded to scholars wanting to study agriculture,” she said. The 2018 SleepOut Movement presents several unique new opportunities for everyone in South Africa to #RiseToTheChallenge in honour of Nelson Mandela's 100th year and to raise awareness of the plight and injustice of homelessness, as well as raise funds to assist in eradicating this social inequality, in a series of memorable events. This global call to action has seen notable South African business leaders, influencers, learners and entrepreneurs spend a midwinter night outdoors, raising funds and gaining empathy for the homeless to benefit selected beneficiaries, as well as creating an ongoing commitment to change in the leaders themselves.
