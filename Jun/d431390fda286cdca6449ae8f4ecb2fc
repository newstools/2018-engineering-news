Fluor Corporation has completed the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) of the Additional Oxygen Capacity Train 17 Outside Battery Limits project at Sasol’s Secunda plant. The EPC project, which was completed in the first quarter of this year, included the integration of Train 17’s product streams with other live operations and Sasol’s largest air separation train, providing 5 000 t/d of oxygen and nitrogen for its synthetic fuels and chemicals manufacturing process. “Fluor demonstrated its integrated solutions approach and ability to execute significant lump-sum EPC projects in this country throughout this project,” Fluor’s South African executive project director Bill Langenbach commented. This project, he added, marked the continuation of a long relationship that has spanned more than half a century and includes some of South Africa’s landmark projects.
