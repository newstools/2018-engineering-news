Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has promoted Richards Bay Port manager Preston Khomo to national ship repair executive manager. Thamsanga Sithole has been appointed to succeed Khomo as Richards Bay Port manager. Both appointments are effective July 1. Khomo will now be responsible for the strategic development of ship repair infrastructure, creating mechanisms for fair and equitable access to infrastructure, as well as the provision of adequate and efficient services. Ship repair facilities are located at the Ports of Durban, East London and Cape Town, where there are dry docks, and at Port Elizabeth and Mossel Bay, where there are slipways. TNPA says ship repair has been under the spotlight since 2014 when government announced its Operation Phakisa oceans economy strategy to unlock potential of the sector. Numerous infrastructure upgrades have been rolled out by TNPA at its facilities, which are in various stages of completion. Khomo will manage the implementation of the current capital programmes at all ship repair facilities. In the short term, TNPA’s focus will be on developing a comprehensive ship repair strategy and tactical plans, and on improving the functionality and efficiency of TNPA’s ship repair business. Khomo will be responsible for assessing market trends and planning capacity to meet demand, as well as ensuring TNPA realises optimal value from its ship repair commercial property portfolio, while meeting its obligations in terms of the National Ports Act.
