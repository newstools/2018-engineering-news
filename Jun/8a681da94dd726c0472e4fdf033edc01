Contact lens manufacturer CooperVision will become the first tenant at JSE-listed Atterbury’s R850-million Randport industrial development, in Gosforth Park, Germiston, Ekurhuleni. Atterbury designed the park to provide 103 000 m2 of modern business space in big box logistics warehouses, as well as showrooms and offices. “Atterbury is pleased to introduce CooperVision to Randport Industrial Park where its new premises will incorporate strategic benefits that unlock efficiencies and value that support its business goals,” says Atterbury development manager Arno du Plessis. He adds that Atterbury’s transaction with CooperVision will trigger the start of the first phase of the business-unit scheme within the development and its associated infrastructure. The development is already zoned and serviced, and the business park is ready to cater for industrial facilities of up to 70 000 m2. The business units at Randport will be developed in two phases. Each phase comprises a large building – 9 500 m2 in the first phase and 6 000 m2 for the second – that is flexible enough for a single tenant or multiple units ranging from 650 m2 up to 6 000 m2. Construction is expected to begin as early as July.
