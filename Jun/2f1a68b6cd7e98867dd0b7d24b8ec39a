South African telecommunications giant MTN on Tuesday said representatives from South Africa’s Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation obtained documents from MTN’s internal and external legal counsel over the ongoing legal dispute between it and Turkish mobile operator Turkcell. Turkcell instituted legal action against MTN in South Africa, after several international and local claims against MTN for allegedly causing the Turkish rival to lose a telecommunications operating licence bid in Iran, in 2004, using alleged acts of bribery and corruption. Turkcell is seeking $4.2-billion in damages. “MTN continues to defend itself in the long-running litigation where Turkcell is claiming damages against MTN as a result of MTN having acquired a 49% interest in Irancell Communication Services, which was awarded the second GSM License in Iran in November 2005,” the group said in an update on Tuesday. The documents, relating to aspects of the Turkcell litigation pursuant to MTN’s original self-reporting of this matter and the Turkcell complaint, were collected on June 1. MTN said it was cooperating fully with the investigation.
