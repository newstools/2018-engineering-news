From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Tissue manufacturer the Twinsaver Group last month opened a new manufacturing plant in Klipriver, on the border of the Midvaal and Ekurhuleni municipalities. Marleny Arnoldi tells us more. Marleny Arnoldi: Twinsaver invested R500-million in the manufacturing facility, in which the most significant piece of equipment is a 25 000 t/y Toscotech machine, which is the first of its kind in the southern hemisphere. It can produce between 1 800 m and 2 000 m of tissue material a minute. The machine is fed virgin fibre to make the tissue material, which can then be used to produce toilet paper, dry wipes and facial tissues. Twinsaver Group CEO Garth Towell discusses the company’s export potential and extended manufacturing. The Twinsaver Group CEO Garth Towell: Marleny Arnoldi: With a machine that size and with its delicate Yankee drier component, Towell discusses the challenges in getting the machine to South Africa and how Twinsaver managed them. The Twinsaver Group CEO Garth Towell: Marleny Arnoldi: The construction of the manufacturing facility took about 15 months to complete. The leading contractor Toscotec, along with Arup, oversaw the turnkey delivery of the plant equipment. This entailed stock preparation systems for virgin pulp, a tissue machine encompassing the latest dry crepe tissue technology, as well as plant auxiliaries, control systems and electrification – the energy savings of which is between 15% and 20%.
