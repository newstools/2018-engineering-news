Investec Aviation Finance has completed its first transaction with privately-owned airline SA Airlink, for the acquisition of three E170 aircraft. Airlink has taken delivery of the aircraft over the last seven months. The transaction closed in May and marked Airlink adding its first Embraer E170 regional jet to its E-Jet family as part of the airline’s fleet regeneration strategy. The 74-seater E170 is the first aircraft of its kind for Airlink and will enhance the company’s ability to provide connectivity in Southern Africa and beyond. “This is the continuation of our growth and fleet modernisation strategy that will see us replacing some of our current fleet of Avro RJ85s over the next three years.” “The unique performance characteristics of the E-Jet family will enable Airlink to operate more efficiently within the challenging environment of the region and provides us with a sound basis for further growth,” said Airlink CEO Rodger Foster. Investev Aviation Finance head David Minty added that, despite the economic environment, the past year has been relatively busy, with South African and other African airlines renewing and expanding their fleets. “We expect the trend to continue for the next 12 months, especially with an improved macroeconomic environment on the continent.”
