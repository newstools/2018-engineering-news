Gauteng Premier David Makhura is planning to engage, during July, all municipalities across Gauteng in an effort to gain more support for the province’s Tshepo one-million programme. The Premier on Friday said municipalities and metropolitans are not supporting the roll-out of the programme, with the youth calling on leadership to intervene and ensure that all mayors are held accountable on youth development. Further, as feedback from the youth show the programme to be invisible “on the ground” where the unemployed are, Makhura will also appoint regional coordinators in the five corridors of Gauteng. The programme has resulted in the training of more than 73 000 youth during 2017/18 in the skills demanded by the economy. Some 8 000 obtained decent permanent jobs, while 5 400 were placed in temporary and transitional jobs, he said. Another 222 were assisted to start their own enterprises. Further, over the past three-and-a-half years, more than 470 000 young people were empowered with skills, access to decent employment, transitional jobs, bursaries and internships and business opportunities. “The focused intervention study conducted by the oversight committee on the Office of the Premier and Legislature confirms that the partnership between Harambee, the private sector and Gauteng government on Tshepo one-million has opened substantial opportunities for the inclusion of the youth in the economy,” Makhura concluded.
