The Department of Labour (DoL) will, on Monday, resume its inquiry into the Grayston drive pedestrian and cyclist structural bridge collapse with testimony from the Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA). The October 2015 incident resulted in the death of two people, while 19 others were injured. The scaffolding, which was intended to have been used as an interim support measure during construction of a pedestrian bridge parallel to the Grayston Bridge, gave way, collapsing on the high-traffic M1 highway. The DoL-led inquiry, which had its first sitting in February 2016, has faced several delays, with the last sitting held in September 2017. It is now being led by a new presiding inspector Phumudzo Maphaha, who takes over from Lennie Samuels. The latest sitting of the inquiry will continue until July 5. A total of 13 sessions are expected to be held between July and September, the DoL said on Friday.
