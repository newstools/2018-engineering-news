To help overcome the water crisis in South Africa, IFAT Africa and the Water Institute of Southern Africa (Wisa) will launch a cooperation venture as of this week. The aim is to forge ahead with drinking water production, water supply and wastewater treatment in the drought-plagued country by means of professional know-how and appropriate technologies. IFAT Africa is a trade show for environmental technologies in sub-Saharan Africa and Wisa is the biggest water and wastewater industry professionals board in South Africa. “We must intertwine technologies and expert knowledge more closely with each other to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable supply of water as a vital resource also in Southern Africa,” says IFAT Africa organiser Messe München MD Stefan Rummel. IFAT Africa will act as an official partner of the Wisa conference, being held in Cape Town, from June 24 to 27, and Wisa will assist with lectures and workshops at the next IFAT Africa event from July 9 to 11.
