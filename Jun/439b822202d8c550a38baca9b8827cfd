Russian State-owned nuclear group Rosatom has announced that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Infrastructure of Rwanda. The MoU covers cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. This is the first agreement between the two countries regarding the peaceful uses of atomic energy. It was signed by Rosatom deputy director-general and International Affairs Department director Nikolay Spasskiy and Rwandan Ambassador to Russia Jeanne dâ€™Arc Mujawamariya. The MoU sets out the legal foundations for the institution of nuclear cooperation between the two parties.
