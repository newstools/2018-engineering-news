The Land and Agricultural Development Bank of South Africa (Land Bank) has welcomed recent appointments to its board, which it believes will serve to strengthen its commitment to good corporate governance. The recent appointments include MA Moloto as the new chairperson of the board, D Hlatshwayo as the newly-appointed deputy chairperson of the board and chairperson of the Land Bank Insurance Companies’ board, and SA Lund as the chairperson of the risk and governance committee. In addition, Dr ST Coenlius and M Makgoba have been appointed as new board members for a period of three years, effective June 1, as successors to outgoing nonexecutive directors. Land Bank’s responsive board continues to play a critical role in providing governance and oversight on its core mandate of facilitating transformation and inclusive access to the agricultural sector, the development bank said.
