Allied Electronics (Altron) is moving to acquire the entire issued share capital of iS Partners for R225-million, effective July 1. Through wholly owned subsidiary Altron TMT, a share sale agreement was concluded that included iS Partners primary subsidiaries Karabina Solutions and Zetta Business Solutions. “This acquisition will enable us to create a Microsoft-focused business within Altron with a special focus on cloud computing and data analytics. The acquisition will add scale and a new suite of solutions and capabilities, enabling customers to digitally transform their businesses through Microsoft technologies,” Altron CEO Mteto Nyati said on Monday. iS Partners is expected to provide a strong and strategic platform from which a standalone Microsoft-focused business can be created within Altron, becoming the only business unit within the group, other than Bytes UK, to provide solutions and services based on a Microsoft strategy and build a cloud and data analytics business of scale. Karabina focuses on the implementation, customisation, integration and core application development on the Microsoft platform for business intelligence, customer relationship management, knowledge management and corporate performance management solutions. Zetta is a specialised advisory, consulting and technology solutions firm centred around business intelligence, big data master, data management enterprise and content management. The transaction remains subject to conditions, including Competition Commission approval.
