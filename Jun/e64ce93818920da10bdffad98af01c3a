Beverage producer Distell relisted on the beverage sector of the JSE on Friday. “Today marks an important journey in our company’s evolution as it simplifies a historically multitiered ownership structure of Distell, through investment holding company Capevin, providing investors with a single-entry point to invest in Distell,” MD Richard Rushton said at the listing. The beverage sector comprises 14% of the overall JSE market cap and translates to R14.27-trillion.
