Zambia has shortlisted ten regional and international companies to build a total of 100 MW of solar electricity projects by 2020, the director of the project said on Friday. Zambia is heavily dependent on hydropower and following a drought in 2016, an electricity shortage hit Africa's No.2 copper producer, forcing it to ration power supply to the mines. The country has since embarked on a policy to diversify to renewable forms of energy to ensure security of electricity supply. "The shortlisting was done yesterday. We will launch the request for proposal sometime in July," Global Energy Transfer Feed-in Tariff Zambia programme director William Pearson told Reuters on the sidelines of a mining and energy conference.
