The Competition Commission will hold public hearings into the land-based public passenger transport market from June 4 to 6, at Constitution Hill, in Johannesburg, and from June 7 to 8 at Manhattan Hotel, in Pretoria. The commission is conducting a transport market inquiry into the land-based public passenger transport sector to understand the general state of competition. The commission says it has reason to believe there are features in this sector that may prevent, distort or restrict competition. The focus of the hearings will include price setting mechanisms, price regulation, route allocation, allocation of operational subsidies, transport planning and transformation in terms of ownership patterns in the industry. The inquiry panel will be chaired by the commissionâ€™s legal counsel chief Bukhosibakhe Majenge.
