The European Union could start measures by mid-July to curb steel imports, which could be surging due to US tariffs, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said on Tuesday. The European Commission launched an investigation into possible "safeguard" measures at the end of March. It is set to last up to nine months. "This is an investigation that will probably take until the end of the year before we can get the full picture," Malmstrom told a news conference. "We are seriously contemplating to have provisional measures in place, I would say mid-July could be some provisional measures. Exactly what form that will take is still under discussion."
