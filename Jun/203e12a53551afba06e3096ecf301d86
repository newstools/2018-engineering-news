The Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA) has appointed Alberton-based road construction company Boitshoko Construction Road & Surfacing to undertake the first phase upgrade of the Merafe railway station, in Soweto. The R26-million upgrade started this month and will be completed in October 2019. The project is part of the City of Johannesburg’s initiative to improve public transport facilities in all the seven regions, including upgrading pedestrian walkways connecting to all Metrorail stations in Soweto to improve pedestrian mobility. This part of the upgrade will include street lighting and services enhancement where required, while the scope of work includes drainage, sidewalks, kerbs, paving, street lighting and landscaping. The JDA will also upgrade the Mzimhlophe railway station, in Soweto, for R26-million to improve pedestrian mobility. The project will be phased based on budget availability. “The overall aim of the projects is to allow for safer movement between different amenities and integration with the public transport facilities,” says JDA CEO Christo Botes.
