The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) on Tuesday welcomed its new group CEO, Sibusiso Sithole, who has been appointed for a period of 12 months, effective June 1. Appointed to stabilise PRASA, Sithole is the former eThekwini municipality city manager and Umgeni Water Board GM. PRASA board chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama expressed the hope that Sithole would “hit the ground running”. “Mr Sithole is quite aware of the immense challenges facing the organisation. PRASA is at its worst performance levels and there is an expectation from the public . . . for the organisation to turn itself around. “We cannot overemphasise what our expectation as a board is from the CEO. Fortunately with the kind of experience he has, we should not expect any difficulty in him executing the task at hand.” Sithole holds a B. Proc (Law) degree from University of Natal, a Masters degree in Education from Manchester University (UK), a MBA in Corporate Strategy (UNISA), and is currently pursuing a Doctor of Business Administration with Walden University (US).
