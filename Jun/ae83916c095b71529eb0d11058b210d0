The upgrade of the Rothdene pumpstation, in Meyerton, is 99% complete and will be finalised by the end of June. The project started in June last year and is four pumps with a capacity of 440 ℓ/s comprise the upgrade, which, upon completion, will open the opportunity for the Midvaal municipality to start several housing and social housing developments in the area. The upgrade, which is funded by the Department of Water and Sanitation, involves construction of a rising main to connect to the Meyerton Wastewater Treatment Works, about 4.5 km away, by carrying out earthworks and civil and mechanical works. The site is located in the south of Meyerton on the existing pumpstation site, which was established in the late 1960s. The rationale behind the upgrade, said DWS Gauteng Regional Bulk Infrastructure Programme assistant regional project manager Sefako Mamabulo, is owing to a growing need for the Midvaal municipality to provide housing and other developments in the area. “That was hampered by the lack of sewerage treatment capacity in the area, which the project will be addressing,” he noted. It is the intention of Midvaal municipality to upgrade the pumpstation to accommodate growth in the area. Once the upgrade has been completed, the project will be transferred to the Midvaal municipality, which will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the pumpstation.
