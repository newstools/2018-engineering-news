South Africa and Japan have signed a memorandum of cooperation (MoC) focused on infrastructure development and technical cooperation in water resource management. The MoC will see the Department of Water and Sanitation in South Africa and the Department of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in Japan exchange ideas and knowledge on issues in the water sector to benefit both countries. “This is with the intention of forging a long-term cooperative relationship that will assist both countries to face the ever changing dynamics in the water sector,” said Water and Sanitation Minister Gugile Nkwinti, who signed the MoC with Japanese Ambassador to South Africa Shigeyuki Hiroki on Friday. “Japan is known for its new technology inventions and that is what we need as South Africa, as we are faced with the effects of drought and other challenges in the water sector,” Nkwinti added. The MoC included integrated water resource management; water-related disaster management; wastewater treatment; the development, operations, maintenance and management of infrastructure; and technical standards and new technologies. This followed last year’s signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Japan International Cooperation Agency to find solutions for the lack of technical skills in the South African water sector. A joint commission on cooperation in the field of water resources management will be established to ensure seamless working relations and the organisation of technical workshops, training, study tours and seminars in each country.
