Cape Town-based e-commerce start-up business Digital Online Retail Products (Dorp) has launched its first product – Veldskoen – in the UK and Europe, after lifestyle assets corporation Long4Life acquired 49% of the company in April. Dorp co-founder and CEO Nick Dreyer says the company is excited to bring its South African brands to a global audience. “In the short space of time that Veldskoen has been trading in the UK, it has already seen success.” Veldskoen is a reimagined version of the classic South African brown leather shoe. Dreyer says the start-up is considering the US and Australia as the next potential markets to launch the product. “Launching a retail brand in the UK and Europe is a challenge. The fashion retail market is already highly competitive, but we believe that the quality of our product and ability to tell our brands’ stories will make us competitive,” he notes.
