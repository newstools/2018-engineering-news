Trade unions involved in wage negotiations with Eskom will give a joint response to the power utility's revised 4.7 percent wage offer when the talks resume for the second day on Wednesday morning. In a joint statement, the National Union of Mineworkers, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, and Solidarity said they met with Eskom management through the Central Bargaining Forum on Tuesday where the revised offer was tabled. "All unions have received the offer and are debating it. We will give a joint response in the morning to Eskom management when the second day of wage talks resume on Wednesday. We cannot confirm at this time what our response to the offer is until we have communicated it to Eskom," they said. Eskom is offering a four-year wage deal with a guaranteed increase based on inflation. For the year 2018, the offer is 4.7 percent, and an inflation based increase every year thereafter for the next four years. The utility's response to all other demands, including an increase in housing allowance; payment of performance bonuses and all other benefits, remain the same.
