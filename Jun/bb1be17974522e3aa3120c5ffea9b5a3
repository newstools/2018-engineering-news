As the years-delayed digital terrestrial television (DTT) project remains beset with numerous challenges inhibiting the full transition from analogue to digital broadcasting, the Department of Communications (DoC) has starting building a dedicated project management office (PMO) outside the structure of the department. Communication Minister Nomvula Mokonyane said this week that the department, which has also reviewed the model to drive the project, has appointed Aldred Dreyer to lead the PMO and the entire DTT project after successfully leading a similar project in Namibia. “Through the support of the department, he will be assembling his own team and, as a team, they will be engaging the industry,” she said. Further, the DoC plans to announce a revised advisory council to advise Mokonyane on various issues, including the analogue switch-off plan, strategies to increase DTT uptake by households and to support the PMO. “The council shall include representatives of both government and industry to ensure that the project is driven in a joint manner in the spirit of inclusivity,” she assured stakeholders. “As this project continues to be delayed, it has serious implications both for government, industry and our citizens. Having considered all the challenges, a revision to the current delivery model is inevitable if we are to accelerate the country towards the now belated analogue switch-off.” In line with this, the model to drive the project has been reviewed, particularly the elements of partnerships and collaborations with industry; efficiency and affordability by building on existing infrastructure and distribution networks; inclusive participation; and transparency and accountability. The model will be revealed once the DoC’s consultations with Cabinet are concluded in due course.
