The International Air Transport Association (Iata) and Deloitte have published an Airport Ownership and Regulation guidance booklet to assist governments considering public–private partnership (PPP) or privatisation programmes for airport infrastructure development. With the increasing demand for air connectivity outpacing the capacity of current airport infrastructure, many governments are challenged in finding the effective financing to enable critical expansion. "The global growth ... is increasingly putting airport [infrastructure] under pressure, increasing the need for governments to explore alternative financing solutions and enhance management efficiency,” said Iata director-general and CEO Alexandre de Juniac. The guidance booklet is expected to support governments to better assess private sector participation options, building on industry best practice and the results of research into the effectiveness of different ownership and operating models from the perspective of a range of stakeholders. “It is important that governments considering privatisation or PPPs take a long-term view and focus on solutions that will maximise the economic and social benefits of connectivity,” he said. “There is a critical need to ensure strategic objectives are appropriately assessed and the benefits and risks understood when evaluating airport ownership and operating model options.” The Airport Ownership and Regulation booklet explores the assessment of the options for models of privatisation, the best practices for the process of privatisation and the regulation of privatised airports, besides others. The booklet was commissioned by Iata and researched by Deloitte.
