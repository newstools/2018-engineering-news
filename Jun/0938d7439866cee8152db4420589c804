The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) aims to increase the voter’s roll by about one-million to at least 27-million people before the 2019 national elections take place. National elections are expected to be held at some stage between May and August next year. While the elections can neither eliminate poverty nor reduce inequality, it can set the country on the right path to achieving these goals, says IEC CEO Sy Mamabolo. He stated that it remains important for young people to register with the IEC in order to cast their votes. He noted that it was a challenge to get young people to register, but, once they have, statistics show that their participation in the voting process grows and they thus impact “what happens in the country”. Mamabolo said the commission will continue to focus on interacting with and getting young citizens involved in the voting process. To ensure better management of new registrations and voters’ addresses, the IEC has procured about 38 000 new voter registration devices which are equipped with location technology and the instant capturing of particulars of new voters. The IEC will employ 250 000 people during the election period across 22 000 voting stations. “Credible elections are critical for the realisation of macroeconomic and political stability necessary for inclusive growth,” he stated.
