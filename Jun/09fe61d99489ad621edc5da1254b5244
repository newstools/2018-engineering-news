All recognised trade unions at Eskom met with South Africa's power utility on Tuesday to restart wage talks and would debate the new offer, the unions said. In a joint statement, the National Union of Mineworkers, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, and Solidarity said they met with Eskom management through the Central Bargaining Forum. "Eskom is offering a four-year wage deal with a guaranteed increase based on inflation. For the year 2018 the offer is 4.7 percent, and an inflation based increase every year thereafter for the next four years. All other demands which have been submitted remain unaltered," the unions said in a joint statement. "It is Eskomâ€™s proposal that all other demands regarding an increase in housing allowance; payment of performance bonus and insourcing and all other benefits will not be improved and remain unchanged. All unions have received the offer and are debating it. We will give a joint response in the morning to Eskom management when the second day of wage talks resume on Wednesday." The unions said they would not confirm their response to the offer until they have communicated it to Eskom.
