The National Union of Mineworkers (Num) on Monday slammed reports that it had called for the postponement of wage negotiations with power utility Eskom because of its congress this week. "The Num congress is starting on Wednesday at the Birchwood Hotel and that will not affect the wage negotiations as there will be another team from the Num that will fully participate in the wage negotiations," Num spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu said. "The Num will fully participate in the Eskom wage negotiations starting tomorrow until Thursday at the Cedarwood Park in Woodmead. The Num is not calling for the postponement of the Eskom wage negotiations." Public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan announced on Friday that Eskom and three trade unions would resume wage talks this week after these deadlocked. The power utility has conceded to remove its zero percent wage increase from the negotiating table.
