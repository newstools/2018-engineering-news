The Airports Company of South Africa (ACSA) says it is working with its counterparts in Mozambique, Zambia and Ghana on the commissioning of airports. ACSA COO Fundi Sithebe says the company is assisting the Zambian government in commissioning its Kenneth Kaunda International Airport, as well as collaborating with Ghana on the commissioning of a new terminal in Accra. ACSA is also in talks with the Mozambican authorities. “In Africa, we are surpassing global economic growth. Africa is the place to be and needs to be connected,” Sithebe told the AviaDev conference, in Cape Town, on Wednesday. She said airports, airlines and cities needed to work together to grow routes within the continent. ACSA is also continuing to work in India and Brazil, in helping to develop airports in Mumbai and Sao Paolo respectively. Sithebe said ACSA was also looking into the ‘aerotropolis’ trend, as cities were increasingly going to be built around airports. Businesses would be able to have speedy connectivity to their suppliers, customers and partners both nationally and internationally. ACSA’s nine airports handle 36-million passengers a year. The Skytrax World Airport Awards recently listed Cape Town International Airport as the twenty-first best airport in the world, followed by King Shaka International in twenty-sixth place and OR Tambo International in thirty-second place. Singapore’s Changi International took first place for the sixth year in a row, followed by South Korea’s Incheon airport, Tokyo Handea, Hong Kong and Doha’s Hamad airport.
