State-owned South African Airways (SAA) has added additional flights to the Eastern Cape to cater for business travelers between East London and Johannesburg. SAA currently operates 24 flights a week between Johannesburg and East London, with a double daily service (except on Monday and Saturday). From June 10, the airline will offer additional flights on three days of the week, increasing the service to 30 flights a week. SAA has scheduled the additional flights to cater specifically for the business traveler wanting to travel in time for meetings and requiring additional flexibility for return flights. “Adding these early departures out of East London and late returns from Johannesburg is an ideal way for business travellers from the coastal city to be in Johannesburg early morning to conclude their business and return the same day,” commented SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali. The additional flights will depart on Mondays and Thursdays from East London at 06:30 to arrive in Johannesburg at 07:55; and at 08:00 on Saturdays to arrive at 09:25. The additional return flights will be on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays from Johannesburg at 18:55 to arrive in East London at 20:20.
