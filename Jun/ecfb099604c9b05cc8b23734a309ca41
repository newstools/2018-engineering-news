The sale of JSE-listed Barloworld’s lossmaking Iberian Equipment operations to Italian group for R2.18-billion has closed. “The closing of the sale of Iberia is the first milestone in redeploying the group’s capital,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Barloworld further noted that it is focused on reducing capital deployed where the returns are below the company’s hurdle rates of return.
