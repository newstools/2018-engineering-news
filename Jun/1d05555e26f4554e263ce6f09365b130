Zambia plans to introduce electricity tariffs that reflect the cost of power production by the end of 2018 and move away from a flat tariff of 9.30 US cents/kilowatt hour for mining companies, a senior government official said on Thursday. The permanent secretary for energy Emelda Chola said in a statement at a mining and energy conference that the government had implemented the first phase of the migration by raising the price of electricity last year.
