JSE-listed Stefanutti Stocks on Thursday announced several leadership changes, including the retirement of CEO Willie Meyburgh on May 31, 2019. Russell Crawford, currently MD of the company's construction and mining business unit, has been appointed CEO-designate, and will report to Meyburgh from July 1, 2018. This transitional arrangement will remain in place until May 31 next year, when Crawfordâ€™s appointment as CEO and company director will be formalised. This arrangement, the company said on Thursday, will provide a structured handover at a time when experience, industry knowledge and stability are essential to the continued success of the business. On June 1 next year, Meyburgh will be appointed as a nonexecutive director of the company, which Stefanutti says will ensure that his institutional knowledge, wide experience in the construction sector and wise counsel are retained at board level. Further, Kevin Eborall will retire as chairperson and director of the company with effect from May 31, 2019. Zanele Matlala, who currently serves as the chairperson of the audit, governance and risk committee, will be appointed board chairperson as from June 1, 2019.
