From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Simulated Training Solution’s world-first VR blast wall and its VR cube have resulted in efficient, effective and memorable training programmes for Anglo American Platinum’s Engineering Services Training Centre and Murray and Roberts Cementation Training Academy. Nadine James has the story. Nadine James: STS VR head Johan Bouwer explains that the VR cube was specifically developed for the needs of Amplats ESTC, while the VR Blast Wall was a collaborative development between STS and Sasol Nitrate. STS VR head Johan Bouwer: Nadine James: MRTA’s Virtual Blast Wall is encased in a refurbished shipping container that includes a 9-m-long printed canvas, made to look like a stope approaching the blast face. MRTA education training and development executive Tony Pretorius describes the fruitful relationship between STS which led to the academy acquiring several VR products. MRTA education training and development executive Tony Pretorius: Nadine James: Pretorius believes that VR technologies are superior to traditional teaching and training methods because they are much more immersive and, therefore, more effective. MRTA education training and development executive Tony Pretorius: Nadine James: Bouwer adds that introducing an element of fun has resulted in unforeseen benefits. STS VR head Johan Bouwer: Sashnee Moodley: That’s Creamer Media’s Real Economy Report. Join us again next week for more news and insight into South Africa’s real economy.
