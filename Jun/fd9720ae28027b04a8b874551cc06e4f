State-owned power utility Eskom’s power stations and other critical facilities continue to operate optimally, in line with the contingency measures put in place to ensure security of power supply during a period of “wildcat strikes”. “There are, however, a few isolated incidents where some protesting workers tried to blockade the entrances to our power stations, but these situations have been quelled by the presence of the Public Order Police. The situation remains tense but stable,” said Eskom. This follows after unions, the National Union of Mineworkers and Solidarity, declared a dispute with Eskom about its 0% wage increase offer earlier this month.
