Wage negotiations between the South African power utility Eskom and three key trade unions will resume on Tuesday after all parties agreed to go back to the negotiating table for three days of talks. The power utility has agreed to withdraw its zero percent wage increase offer as the unions have not moved from their demands of up to 15% wage increases plus a R2 000 housing subsidy, among others. The unions also want to engage about issues that impact on the future sustainability of Eskom such as coal costs, the impact of policy including independent power producers, and the bloated top executive structure of Eskom management. Since workers last week began picketing at Eskom power stations over stalled wage negotiations, the power utility has begun implementing load-shedding due to a shortage of capacity which is expected to last for the next week or so.
