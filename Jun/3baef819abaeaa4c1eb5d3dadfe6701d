To add digital commerce capabilities to its digital business solutions portfolio, Dimension Data is acquiring a majority stake in digital commerce consultancy e2y for an undisclosed amount. e2y is expected to add further skills to Dimension Data’s digital infrastructure consulting and services proposition, while its strength in the UK and Europe, combined with Dimension Data’s presence in the Middle East and Africa, the Americas and Asia Pacific, will open up new markets for existing clients to leverage a “truly compelling” digital commerce solution. “With the future of commerce being firmly focused on the experience of trading online, and our digital business solutions portfolio centered on driving innovation for our clients, our investment in e2y will bring our clients closer to their customers on these advanced commercial platforms,” said Dimension Data digital business solutions group executive Scott Gibson. e2y CEO Laurent Christen added: “The digitisation of goods and services disrupts established business models and existing value chains, enabling new models to emerge.”
