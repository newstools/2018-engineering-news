The Hilton hotel group will remove plastic straws and plastic water bottles from its 650 managed properties by the end of this year. The company on Wednesday revealed its goal of cutting its global environmental impact in half by 2030. The hotel group will offer guests a paper or biodegradable alternative to plastic straws upon request. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa (Emea) alone, the commitment will remove more than five-million plastic straws and 20-million plastic water bottles yearly. “Extending a ban on plastic straws across our managed portfolio is an important move in the right direction, and one which we are committed to building on in the coming years,” Hilton Emea president Simon Vincent said in a statement. He noted that an estimated eight-million tons of plastic waste enters the ocean each year, and research projects that plastic in the world’s oceans could triple in a decade. “Plastic pollution not only impacts our waters and marine life, but also our food chain and overall health,” he said.
