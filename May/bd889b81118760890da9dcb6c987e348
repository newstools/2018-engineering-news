The process of designating the Atlantis Special Economic Zone (SEZ) is to be completed within two months, says Trade and Industry Deputy Minister Bulelani Magwanishe. Magwanishe spoke at a business engagement session on Friday, hosted by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), in partnership with the Western Cape government, the City of Cape Town and the departments of Telecommunication and Postal Services, Small Business Development, Economic Development, Home Affairs and Water and Sanitation. The session was aimed at sharing information and business opportunities with the residents and businesspersons in Atlantis and surrounding areas, as well as sharing updates on the progress of the Atlantis SEZ. The SEZ is to be developed as a GreenTech hub with a particular focus on clean technologies, electronics, solar and wind energy technologies, energy efficient technologies, alternative waste management and alternative building materials and technologies. The DTI has contributed about R22-million towards funding the Atlantis SEZ, which has already attracted 30 foreign and local enterprises. The investors have collectively invested R680-million, creating 300 new direct jobs. Magwanishe assured those in attendance at the session of the DTIâ€™s commitment to assist small, medium-sized and microenterprises from Atlantis to benefit from the SEZ, with help from the Small Business Development Department. Small Business Development Deputy Minister Cassel Mathale commented that the session showed the commitment of all the spheres of government to work together in reducing unemployment and crime. Western Cape Finance MEC Ivan Meyer added that while businesses receive support and incentives from government, they should treat them as a base and become sustainable businesses beyond these initiatives.
