Property developers Abland, Giflo Develoments and SOM have started work on a new mixed-use precinct called Irene Boulevard, in the south of Pretoria. This site will become the new four-star rated green headquarters of industrial company Barloworld Logistics, which will be vacating its offices in Sandton to occupy the new site. “What started as a retail centre deal has evolved into a mixed-use precinct, where Abland will be integrating retail and commercial offerings. “The precinct came to life after Abland shared its master plan with Barloworld, which was impressed with the offerings of the precinct and immediately bought into the bigger concept,” notes Abland development director Thinus Delport. The precinct will offer a bespoke lifestyle and a 16 000 m2 shopping centre to the Irene market, with Barloworld Logistics’ headquarters comprising 5 500 m2. Construction on the precinct started in mid-March and is anticipated for completion in April 2019. Construction on Phase 2 of the development – the retail leg – will start in the third quarter of this year and will include a leading national grocer, restaurants and beauty and health facilities. The Irene Boulevard site is conveniently located on Alexander road just off the Botha avenue interchange, with great exposure and easy access to the N1 highway. “We are excited to be co-creating this new space which aligns to our growth ambitions and will offer employees a superb environment to experience all the precinct promises to offer,” says Barloworld Logistics CEO Kamogelo Mmutlana.
