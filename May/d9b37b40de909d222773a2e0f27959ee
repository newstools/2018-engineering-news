Lesedi Nuclear has rebranded the company descriptor from ‘nuclear services’ to ‘power generation, mining, oil & gas’ to reflect its extended offering, purpose and vision for the future. Lesedi revealed its new identity and brand positioning to its internal stakeholders on May 11, with the external launch having taken place at the African Utility Week on May 15. The new brand identity is encapsulated in the graphic of the African Adinkra symbol for energy, which emphasizes the importance of the relationship that Lesedi builds with all its stakeholders, the company said. “With Lesedi evolving to a firmly established African company, the rebranding of the company reflects its purpose and vision for the future: To be the leading engineering, procurement and construction enterprise recognised for empowering and energising the enrichment of the African continent,” Lesedi CEO Francis Carruthers said.
