Global passenger traffic results for March show that demand, measured in revenue passenger kilometres (RPK), rose by 9.5% year-on-year, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) reported on Thursday. Capacity, measured in available seat kilometres (ASK) grew by 6.4% year-on-year and load factor climbed 2.3 percentage points to 82.4%, which set a record for the month, following on the record set in February. All regions, except the Middle East, posted record load factors. “Demand for air travel remains strong, supported by the comparatively healthy economic backdrop and business confidence levels. However, rising cost inputs – particularly fuel prices – suggest that any demand boosts from lower fares will moderate going into the second quarter,” noted Iata director-general and CEO Alexandre de Juniac. African airlines continued to enjoy strong demand, with traffic up 11.2% year-on-year, which was more than twice the five-year average pace of 4.8%. “Airlines in Africa are seeing healthy growth on routes to and from Europe and Asia, while the region’s two largest economies – South Africa and Nigeria – continue to improve,” stated Iata. Capacity climbed 6.7% and load factor strengthened by 2.9 percentage points to 71%. Africa’s RPK rose by 6.1% and ASK by 2.7%. De Juniac concluded that the strong first-quarter provides healthy momentum heading into the peak travel period in the northern hemisphere. Benign economic conditions are supporting – and being supported by – good demand for air travel.
