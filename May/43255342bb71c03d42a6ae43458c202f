Civil engineering and construction group Esor has postponed the release of its annual financial statements for the year ended February 28 to June 29. The group on Friday said it still needed to confirm various claims and provisions on certain material contracts and the related impact on revenue recognition and would, therefore, not be in a position to publish its results by May 31, as is required by the listings requirements of the JSE.
