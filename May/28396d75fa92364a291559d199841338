Tullow Oil is interested in new oil blocks off Ghana's coast as part of the British explorer's plans to consolidate its operations in the West African nation, Chief Executive Paul McDade said on Thursday. Tullow is leading two operations offshore Ghana, including the country's flagship 100 000 bbl/d Jubilee field, which began commercial production in late 2010.
