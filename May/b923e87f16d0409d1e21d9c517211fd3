Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) will shut down the Natal Corridor (Natcor) line, from Rietvlei, Gauteng, to the Durban Harbour, from May 8 to 14 for maintenance and refurbishment. The shutdown schedule will encompass a partial shut from May 8 to 10, meaning there will be a reduced service, while there will be a double line closure from May 10 to 12 during which time there will be no trains running along the corridor. The maintenance activities will include all aspects of rail infrastructure such as turn out replacement; formation rehabilitation; installation of contact wire; installation of pin insulators; maintenance of cross overs; decommissioning points at the cross over sites; maintenance of locomotives, wagons and other equipment; scissor crossing installations; sleeper replacement; and overhead track equipment rehabilitation, besides other activities. TFR continues to invest to ensure that there is a significant reduction in incidents that disrupt train operations, the company said. “This is to enable Transnet’s strategic intent of attracting more rail-friendly cargo by operating a safe, predictable and reliable railway service that meets our customers’ needs and, hence, contributes positively to the socioeconomic objectives of the country and the rest of the African continent.”
