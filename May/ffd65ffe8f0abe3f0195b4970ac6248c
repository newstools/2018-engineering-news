As many as 1 000 South African youths stand to benefit from a healthcare skills development programme in line with government's call to create opportunities for young people to gain work experience. The opportunities, which have been made available by Netcare, will be spread over a five-year period. Chief executive officer of Netcare Dr Richard Friedland on Wednesday said: â€œInvesting in the youth through enhancing their employability is a direct investment in the future of South Africa, as this is a vehicle for stimulating inclusive economic growth and advancing socio-economic transformation".
