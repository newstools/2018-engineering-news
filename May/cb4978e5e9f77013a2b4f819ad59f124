President Cyril Ramaphosa revealed on Friday that a review of the size and structure of the National Executive and government departments was under way, with a technical task team having been established to undertake the process. In his reply to a national assembly question by the Democratic Alliance about whether the review had begun, Ramaphosa said the Presidency would be the lead department in the task team. Officials from the departments of Public Service and Administration; Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation; National Treasury and Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs will also form part of the task team and review the configuration of national government. In his February State of the Nation address Ramaphosa said that it was crucial that the size and structure of the State was best suited to serve South Africans and ensure the efficient allocation of public resources. “Previous and current configurations of the administration is still in progress, with the view to establishing the synergy between the Constitution and legislation on one hand and the national macro-organisation of the national government, on the other,” said the Presidency in a statement. The review will conclude following due political consultations, and in time for implementation in the sixth administration, assured Ramaphosa.
