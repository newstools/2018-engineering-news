JSE-listed technology group Allied Electronics' (Altron’s) wholly-owned subsidiary Bytes UK has signed a five-year, £150-million (R2.5-billion) contract with the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) to roll out Microsoft’s latest operating system, Windows 10, to all NHS computers. The £30-million-a-year deal followed a competitive bid that included ten other companies. Bytes UK, deemed the largest Microsoft partner in the UK, will now be responsible for the seamless deployment of the Microsoft Windows 10 licences and support as NHS revitalises its technology infrastructure. “The installation of the Windows 10 solution forms part of the NHS’s investment into a more secure infrastructure in the challenging cybersecurity landscape,” explained Bytes UK MD Neil Murphy. The agreement includes the maintenance of a comprehensive inventory and the development of a portal designed to record the licensing process. The implementation will take place alongside numerous other solutions and technologies that have been selected to ensure that the NHS has comprehensive security and system longevity. “This is an extraordinary win for Bytes UK,” said Murphy.
