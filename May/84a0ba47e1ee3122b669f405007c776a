The South African Nuclear Energy Corporation’s (Necsa’s) NTP Radioisotopes arm won the AtomExpo Award for the best project in the nonenergy related use of nuclear energy, on Monday evening, in Sochi, Russia. NTP is a global supplier of radiation-based products for the healthcare industry, as well as for industrial uses. Necsa chairperson Dr Kelvin Kemm said it was “wonderful for South Africa to be recognised as world leaders in nuclear medicine.” “We are looking forward to doubling our output and reaching further into Africa. We’ve had interest from the Middle East and South America, as well as continental Europe to expand even further with our nuclear medicine than the 60 countries that we export to now,” he noted. The project started with theoretical feasibility studies in 2007 and cold experiments were completed in 2008. It took about ten years to convert the process from highly enriched uranium to low enriched uranium, including getting the necessary national and international regulatory approvals. “We are running at a profit. Last year, the turnover for nuclear medicine alone was R1.4-billion, of which R80-million was paid to the South African Revenue Service,” said Kemm. NTP has the second-largest market share globally for radioisotopes and has deliveries taking place three times a day internationally. “We are the major supplier to the US and we hope to expand dramatically,” said Kemm. *Anine Killian is a guest of Rosatom in Russia.
