French President Emmanuel Macron urged the world's biggest economic powers to start talks to reform the World Trade Organization (WTO) to prevent current tensions from spiralling into trade wars. "This is about a complete update of global competition rules," Macron said in a speech on multilateralism at the OECD. "All sides always lose in a trade war." He said he would suggest starting talks with the EU, United States, China and Japan to reach a roadmap for the next G20 meeting in Argentina at the end of the year.
