Consulting engineering firm Nako Group CEO Clint Koopman has decided to step down from his position in order to focus on leading the company’s Structures business unit as MD. Nako Iliso executive chairperson Fuzile Fongoqa, who will succeed Koopman as CEO, remarked that Koopman has been instrumental in leading the company through phases of unprecedented growth, notably the formation of Nako Group following the transaction that resulted in three wholly owned South African engineering companies joining forces to form an African engineering powerhouse. Koopman also played a crucial role in the establishment of a joint venture company called Nako Systra with French multinational Systra – the third largest transportation planning, rail and mass transit engineering company globally. “Koopman’s skill in navigating the company through challenging economic downturns experienced during 2008 and 2010, an again during 2016 and 2017, bears testament to the calibre of leader [he] continues to be,” commented Fongoqa. After the Nako board received notification of Koopman stepping down as CEO, the board used the opportunity to revisit its operational structure and has decided to appoint Eldred Boonzaaier as its new COO.
