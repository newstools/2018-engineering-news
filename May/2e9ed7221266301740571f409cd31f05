South African power utility Eskom on Friday, said it had to evacuate contractor workers at the Kusile power station, in Mpumalanga, after a violent protest erupted by employees of SGB, a subcontractor of Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Africa. Mitsubishi Hitachi is appointed by Eskom to design, manufacture, supply, erect and commission six 800 MW utility steam generators for each of the Kusile and Medupi power stations. Eskom said that the protest was against SGB management, in which workers were demanding that their pay related issues be addressed. "In the interest of safety, all contractors were evacuated from the site and the situation in now stable," Eskom said in a statement.
