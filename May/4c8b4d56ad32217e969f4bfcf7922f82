Tissue manufacturer Twinsaver on Friday opened a new manufacturing plant in Kliprivier, on the border of the Midvaal and Ekurhuleni municipalities, in Gauteng. The R500-million plant increases Twinsaver’s tissue manufacturing capability to 75 000 t/y from 25 000 t/y – making it the largest tissue manufacturer on the continent. The facility boasts a machine, which was procured from Italian multinational Toscotec, that is capable of producing between 1 800 m to 2 000 m of tissue material a minute. The tissue material can then be used to produce toilet paper, wipes and tissues. Optimum design of the machine enables toilet tissue, facial tissue and dry wipes to be produced from one machine. The machine is the first of its kind to be used in the southern hemisphere. Twinsaver CEO Garth Towell noted that tissue consumption in South Africa is growing by 20% a year. Meanwhile, Small Business Development Deputy Minister Cassel Mathale said 200 jobs had been created during the construction of the plant, while a further 33 new jobs had been created for operating the plant. Twinsaver will also incorporate small, medium-sized and microenterprises in supplying materials to be processed. “We are highly conscious of the role that Twinsaver has to play in interaction with business and most importantly social partners, towards a better economy for all,” commented Twinsaver chairperson Richard van Berg.
