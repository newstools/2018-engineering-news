Equipment manufacturer Schramm Hammers & Bits has appointed HUD Mining Supplies as its reverse circulation (RC) consumables distributor for sub-Saharan Africa. The partnership will provide drilling companies greater access to Schramm’s RC hammer products and services in South Africa as well as countries in Southern Africa and most of sub-Saharan Africa. “HUD has a solid history of manufacturing and selling drilling consumables in Africa and is well known in Africa’s mining and exploration industry, making it an ideal distributor of our products and services in the region,” says Schramm Hammers & Bits GM David Marwick. Schramm’s airdrill hammers and bits range will strongly complement HUD’s diamond drilling offering to the African mining and exploration markets. As the industry recovers, Africa will be a demand centre for exploration activity and top-of-the-line equipment will be key, adds HUD GM and director Ian Omand. Schramm’s hammers and bits drill faster, giving more metres per day at significantly lower costs – "exactly what our customers want and need”, concludes Omand.
