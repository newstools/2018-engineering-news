The South African new-vehicle market grew by 3.6% in April, to 36 346 units, compared with the same month last year. The number is not the final tally, however, as it is expected to increase by about 350 units once Fiat Chrysler Automobiles South Africa submits its delayed sales tally by the middle of May. Sales numbers released by the Department of Trade and Industry on Wednesday showed that April new-passenger car sales gained 6.4%, to reach 23 928 units. Sales of new bakkies, minibuses and vans, at 10 580 units, contracted by 1.2%. Sales of medium trucks, at 493 units, dropped by 12.1%. Sales of new heavy trucks and buses gained 1.3%, to 1 345 units. April export sales, at 24 422 vehicles, increased by 0.8%. The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) said in a statement that it expected new-vehicle sales to show steady improvement over the medium term, owing to further recovery in domestic demand. This recovery was to be supported by continued moderation in new vehicle price inflation, rising disposable consumer income and an improvement in South Africa’s political and policy environment. Naamsa also expected “robust global growth” to benefit new-vehicle exports. “Exports are expected to show substantial upward momentum in the months ahead.” Top-selling cars, bakkies and vans in April:
