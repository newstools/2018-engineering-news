The National Nuclear Regulator (NNR) says the payment of application fees by any applicant to the NNR does not automatically secure a nuclear authorisation. This follows reports by media earlier this week that State-owned Eskom's payment of nuclear installation site licence (NISL) application fees will secure the utility a licence for Thyspunt. NNR nuclear power plants regulatory executive Orion Phillips said the NNR carried out work in terms of a licence fee levied on a cost recovery basis for work performed by technical experts in the field of meteorology, oceanography, and geohydrology. “In this instance, the fees paid by Eskom will be for the review of the safety characteristics of the site to determine safety aspects such as seismic safety, emergency preparedness, potential dose to members of the public living within the vicinity of the site, and the environmental impact from a radiation safety perspective,” he explained. The NNR further states that an internal review of the mentioned application is at an advanced stage and, once completed, the NNR will continue with the second stage of its public participation process at an appropriate time.
