Nine film and media declarations contributing R1.92-billion to Cape Town and the entire Western Cape province's economy were facilitated in the 2017/2018 financial year by the film and media promotion unit of Wesgro, the city's tourism, trade & investment promotion agency. In a statement, Wesgro said this would result in approximately 2,449 full time equivalent jobs having been created in the region. "The film and media market is a key contributor to our province’s economy, and the above results bare testimony to this," Wesgro CEO Tim Harris said. "It can garner much more international direct investment and local growth if we maintain and stabilize our legislative and incentive frameworks.” The Western Cape, home to South Africa's tourism capital Cape Town, has been growing traction as a destination of choice for film makers from all over the world and several Hollywood films have at least partially been shot in the region in recent years.
