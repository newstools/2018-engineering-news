Processing and packaging solutions company Tetra Pak hopes to launch a paper straw that is suitable for its portion-sized carton packages, before the end of this year. This forms part of a broader programme to help address the issue of plastic straw waste. Straws play an integral role for portion packages that must be consumed on-the-go but they are also a part of the plastic waste problem. Tetra Pak has been working to encourage consumers to push straws back in the pack once they have consumed the contents so they can be collected along with the rest of the package. “Now work is under way to develop a paper straw that is suitable for use on its portion-size carton packages,” Tetra Pak explains. Tetra Pak product management and commercial operations executive VP Charles Brand adds that there are a number of significant challenges to producing a paper straw with the required properties, even though it sounds simple enough to create the solution. “That said, our development team is confident they can find a solution, and that we will have a paper straw alternative ready to launch by the end of the year.” Tetra Pak packages are, on average, 75% paperboard. Paper straws would be another important step towards the company’s long-term ambition of offering a completely renewable portfolio.
