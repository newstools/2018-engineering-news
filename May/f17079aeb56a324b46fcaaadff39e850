Egypt has set aside 25-billion Egyptian pounds (around $1.4-billion) to be spent over two years on developing the country's electricity network, the electricity minister said on Wednesday. The minister, Mohamed Shaker, told reporters the government had agreed on a loan worth 60-billion Kuwaiti dinars (around $200-million) from the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development to build three new converter stations. He gave no further details.
