JSE-listed Jasco COO Mark van Vuuren is taking the helm as CEO on July 1, as Pete da Silva steps aside to take up the position of nonexecutive director following the group’s restructure. Van Vuuren and Da Silva have, over the past 18 months, worked closely in preparation to ensure leadership continuity within the senior management team as part of the company’s succession planning. “Pete and his executive team have addressed a number of challenges during his time as CEO and successfully implemented the group’s turnaround strategy against tough market conditions,” said chairperson Dr Anna Mokgokong. “The board is confident that Mark will successfully drive the group's growth strategy and wishes him well for the future.” Van Vuuren, who has attended board meetings by invitation over the past 18 months, has been at Jasco for ten years, starting as Jasco ICT Solutions MD and serving as COO since late 2013. He has also been on the group’s executive committee since 2012. “Pete will continue to contribute to the group on the Jasco board in his new role as a nonexecutive director to ensure a smooth transition and to assist the group with its future growth and funding strategy,” Mokgokong concluded.
