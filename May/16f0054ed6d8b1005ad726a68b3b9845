The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has embarked on a R15-million overhaul of sidewalks and the installation of traffic calming measures across five wards in Region B, which is in the centre of Johannesburg. The introduction of traffic calming measures aims to reduce road user accidents, by forcing drivers to reduce speed, the JRA said. Interventions to maintain, rehabilitate and build sidewalks will ensure accidents and risk posed to pedestrian and nonmotorised roads users are reduced, the JRA added. As part of the city’s community-based projects, a site inspection of wards 69, 86, 99, 102 and 117 has been carried out to assess the conditions of sidewalks and the need for traffic calming measures. Some of the traffic calming measures will be implemented at ward 69’s Student lane and St Ermins road in Hursthill; as well as at Ward 86’s Albert street, in Albertville; Fourth road, in Greymont; Eighth street, in Newlands; and Washington drive, in Northcliff. Sidewalks will be built at Ward 99’s First, Third and Fourth avenues, in Linden; Ward 102’s View road, in Bordeaux, and Harley street, in Ferndale; and Ward 117’s Seventh avenue, in Parktown North. Construction work started in April.
