The US decision to launch a national security investigation into car imports marks a further low point in business ties with Europe and could lead to costs of â‚¬6-billion, Germany's DIHK Chambers of Industries and Commerce said on Thursday. "To cite aspects of national security as justification is totally constructed and far-fetched. We almost have to take this as a provocation," DIHK President Eric Schweitzer said. The US administration has launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new US tariffs similar to those imposed on imported steel and aluminum in March.
