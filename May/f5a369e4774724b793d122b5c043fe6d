Xina Solar One, which is owned by a consortium between Abengoa, the Industrial Development Corporation, the Public Investment Corporation and the Xina Community Trust, was officially launched near Pofadder, in the Northern Cape, on Friday. The 300 ha solar thermal plant, which was built by Abengoa, became fully operational on August 1 last year and follows the successful launch of two other solar thermal plants in the Northern Cape, Kaxu Solar One and Khi Solar One. The R9.4-billion Xina Solar One project will supply clean electricity to State-owned Eskom under a 20-year power purchase agreement. The Xina Solar One plant produces about 100 MW of power. The opening was officiated by Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, who said the project was a "critical milestone" in a country still heavily dependent on fossil fuels.
