The Competition Commission will, from June to August, hold public hearings as part of its inquiry into the public passenger transport market and is inviting market participants, the public and other interested groups to take part. The commission in June 2017 launched the market inquiry into the land-based public passenger transport sector, following numerous complaints relating to public transport in the country. The market inquiry seeks to address issues of efficiencies in the provision of public transport, and to understand market dynamics across the entire value chain, including price-setting mechanisms, price regulation, transport planning, allocation of subsidies, route allocation and licensing requirements, as well as transformation. It further seeks to address concerns that prevent, distort or restrict competition in a sector that caters for the transport needs of between 70% to 80% of the population. It will focus on minibus taxis, 4+1s, metered taxis, app-based taxi services, Metrorail, the Gautrain and buses. The commission has published guidelines that contain the rules of participation that will apply to all stakeholders who wish to participate in the proceedings of the market inquiry. Participation is envisaged to be through submissions due by May 25, providing evidence and/or attending public hearings scheduled to take place in all provinces. Submission information and public hearing dates can be found on the commission’s website – www.compcom.co.za.
