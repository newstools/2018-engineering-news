The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) announced on Friday that former African National Congress Member of Parliament Dr Makhosi Khoza will take up the role of executive director and head of the organisation’s Local Government Programme, beginning June. Outa expanded its mandate in February 2016 when the organisation added State-owned entities and State capture to its operations and in 2017, the organisation began to develop its Local Government Programme. Outa CEO Wayne Duvenage said that Khoza has stood out as an ardent champion and fighter of corruption and maladministration within government. “At the risk of her own safety, Dr Khoza has become an icon for truth, justice and good governance within government. She is bold, courageous and comes with a history and experience that suits this role within Outa,” he said. Khoza expressed her excitement about getting involved in a “credible and apolitical platform”. “It just makes more sense to make a difference in South Africa by empowering citizens on a grassroots level and addressing maladministration and corruption in municipalities, free from politics. The intention here is to make a significant impact through civil society and not making noises in Parliament,” said Khoza. Outa chairperson Ferrial Adam said Khoza’s appointment would add a new dimension to the organisation’s board and added that the organisation looked forward to her vision and expertise in the development and rollout of Outa’s Local Government Programme.
