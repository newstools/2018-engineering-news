The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) has published the National Radio Frequency Plan (NRFP) 2018 to allocate radio frequency bands between 8.3 kHz and 3 000 GHz to radio services. The revised NRFP incorporates the decisions taken by the 2015 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-15) and reflects the 2016 edition of the International Telecommunication Union Radio Regulations version, including the frequency allocations relevant to Region 1. The NRFP is also consistent with the Southern African Development Community Frequency Allocation Plan to ensure regional harmonisation, with the resultant benefits on economies of scale. “Harmonisation of radio frequency spectrum for Africa, as well as across the world, is such an important aspect to ensure that we enjoy the benefits of the economies of scale and to warrant that the introduction of new technologies benefit the citizens on the continent,” says Icasa councillor Peter Zimri. The plan has further incorporated emergency communications and disaster relief as identified by WRC-15 to facilitate mobile broadband communications for robust and reliable mission critical emergency services in public protection and disaster relief, such as the police, firefighters, paramedics and disaster response teams.
