Recognising the increasing pressure on the built environment from growing populations and development in African countries, global engineering and infrastructure advisory company Aurecon has appointed Kolosa Madikizela as its unit leader for the built environment, in Gauteng.

“African skylines are going through a period of unprecedented change. Growing populations and digital disruptions are changing how people live, work and play, and I look forward to pursuing ways to grow the built environment unit and take on more work in Africa,” says Madikizela. Aurecon’s built environment capabilities are fundamental to the successful execution of its business strategy and Madikizela’s appointment is key to achieving the company’s business goals, Aurecon Africa MD Ferdi Nell states.

“I am delighted to welcome Kolosa to lead our built environment unit. She will play a key role in bringing together the right people to make sure that we deliver world-class buildings to our clients, as well as use innovation and emerging technologies that will create future-ready African environments,” he says. Aurecon is currently working on some of the most significant buildings across the property, health, education, manufacturing and infrastructure sectors in Africa. These include some of the largest and greenest commercial office buildings in South Africa, such as Aurecon’s Tshwane office at the Lynnwood Bridge Office Park, “The Towers” in Cape Town and Atrium on 5th, in Johannesburg.
