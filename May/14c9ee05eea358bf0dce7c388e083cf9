The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has approved the development of a R20-million pedestrian bridge over railway tracks in Klipspruit, owing to a high volume of pedestrian movement over the railway tracks that lead to the Chiawelo Railway Station. The bridge will prevent the unsafe and illegal crossing of residents over the railway line owing to the absence of an alternative crossing or underground tunnel. With the 12-month project expected to get under way in June, a public consultation process has been undertaken to ensure all interested and affected parties have been engaged on the bridge’s development. “It is in the interest of public safety that the JRA has embarked on interventions to improve the Klipspruit community’s access by constructing a pedestrian bridge. The pedestrian bridge will be located at the corner of Fuschia and Foxglove roads,” Transport MMC Nonhlanhla Makhuba said. She added that, as part of the JRA’s alignment to Universal Access Design and Compliance, a special condition has been included as part of the construction to accommodate persons with special needs, visual and temporary or permanent physical impairments. The design also takes into consideration the access height required against the steep landscape and the construction of a subway ramp for the overpass has therefore been proposed.
