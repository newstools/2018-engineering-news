Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has appointed a new interim board for State-owned Transnet, pending a full appointment, in consultation with Cabinet. The interim board will be led by Popo Molefe as chairperson and includes directors Louis Zeuner, Ramasela Ganda, Ursula Fikelepi, Edward Kieswetter and Dimakatso Matshoga. Gordhan has also removed Seth Radebe, Potso Mathekga and Zainul Nagdee as nonexecutive directors with immediate effect. “Transet is facing serious allegations of maladministration and corruption. The previous board has not demonstrated appreciation of the seriousness of issues at hand or the ability to deal with these decisively in order to protect the entity in the interest of South Africans,” Gordhan said in a statement on Tuesday. He further highlighted that the directors of State-owned companies need to be held to a high standard of corporate governance and accountability, so as to protect the assets of the State. Gordhan is confident the new interim board has the capacity to provide the kind of corporate governance needed during this period, as well as to provide stability and certainty.
