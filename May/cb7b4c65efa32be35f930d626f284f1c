Agriculture business NWK has appointed Tebogo Modise as transformation director, effective from June. His appointment to this new role is a further step in driving the renewed NWK business strategy that aims to add significant value to the South African agriculture and food value chain. “We are particularly proud that we were able to appoint an internal candidate in this key role. Modise is well qualified for the position and knowledgeable about the extent of our diverse business,” said NWK CEO Theo Rabe. Modise has been with NWK since 2009. He brings more than 20 years of management experience in various industries which includes both private and government institutions. His appointment fits in with NWK’s strategy of assisting emerging farmers and aiding transformation. “A transformation director allows us to step up our transformation initiatives and partner meaningfully with local and provincial government, our communities and all segments of the industry that we do business with,” said Rabe.
