Government is making good progress in the establishment of the ferroalloy industrial park at the Limpopo-based Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone (SEZ), as a result of the support of the Chinese government, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) SEZ deputy director-general Sipho Zikode said on Friday. “I led a delegation to China a few weeks ago and we met several Chinese companies which showed an interest in investing in the Musina-Makhado SEZ. These engagements have borne fruits because today the Limpopo Economic Development Agency will be signing memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with many prospective investors,” said Zikode. As part of the international investment promotion and marketing of South Africa’s SEZs and industrial projects, the DTI signed an MoU with China's National Development Reform Commission in 2016. The agreement focused on specific projects such as investment promotion, industrial infrastructure, mineral processing, manufacturing and human capital development. “The Chinese have committed to a ferroalloy smelter, coal-fired power generating units, infrastructure and supporting facilities at the Musina-Makhado SEZ and we are impressed that this commitment is bearing results,” he noted.
