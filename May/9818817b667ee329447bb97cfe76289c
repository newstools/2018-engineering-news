JSE-listed Attacq has refuted allegations by the City of Johannesburg (CoJ) regarding illegal water connections at some of the properties under its management in Waterfall City. The property development company said in statement on Thursday that it was in possession of all paperwork and invoicing in relation to its water connections and consumption and welcomed the opportunity to share the documentation with the relevant authorities. The media earlier this week reported that two property developers were arrested in connection with the alleged illegal water meter connection in Waterfall City and the alleged theft of water worth millions of rands from the CoJ. “We are aware of the allegations in relation to water theft in Waterfall and we would like to place on record that none of our staff have been arrested. We are also aware of reference made to an amount of R8.2-million which was collected with regards to water meters and would like to confirm that Attacq is not a party to this payment,” Attaq CEO Melt Hamman said in a statement on Thursday. Attacq COO Jackie van Niekerk, meanwhile, said the property developer does not condone the illegal use and connection of water and was concerned to learn of inferences relating to properties in its portfolio. “We have the relevant documentation at hand and have approached the CoJ to request clarity on this matter. We will be in a position to provide further comment once we have met with the CoJ and due process has been followed,” she said.
