South African power utility Eskom, which is struggling from a financial crisis, said on Thursday that it would not resort to controlled power blackouts this year despite previous reports that it was facing coal shortages. "There will not be load-shedding this year," said Eskom's acting CE Phakamani Hadebe, referring to forced interruptions to power supply.
