The University of Johannesburg (UJ) on Monday announced that it has received a new research chair following the announcement of the latest round of awards by the National Research Foundation in its South African Research Chairs Initiative (SARChI) programme. The Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment (FEBE) at UJ recently celebrated the appointment of Professor Wellington Didibhuku Thwala, Professor: Construction Project Management and Leadership, as the incumbent of the SARChI Chair in Sustainable Construction Management & Leadership in the Built Environment. “The SARChi does not belong to me but to all my students and those who have supported me throughout my career. I feel great and honoured to be awarded such a prestigious research award,” said Prof Thwala. The South African Research Chairs Initiative was established in 2006 as a strategic intervention of the South African government to reverse brain drain in the public academic and research sector and to develop local expertise. In a statement, the university said Prof Thwala’s role is to increase scientific research capacity through the development of human capacity and by stimulating the generation of new knowledge. The position also requires the Chair to significantly expand the scientific research base of South Africa in a way that supports the implementation of the National Research and Development policies. Since 2006, the Initiative has awarded 199 Research Chairs. Investment in research, through the Research Chairs, is intended to improve South Africa’s international research and innovation competitiveness, while responding to social and economic challenges of the country. It is in this context that the National Development Plan (NDP) Priority Area Research Chair was awarded. The new research chair takes the number of chairs that UJ now hold to 14.
