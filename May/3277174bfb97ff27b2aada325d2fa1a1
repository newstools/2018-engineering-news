Business Unity South Africa (Busa) has welcomed the announcement by Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, before the Portfolio Committee on Energy, that the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) be reopened for public consultation. Busa previously called for the IRP to be subjected to public consultation, including consultation at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac). Busa therefore welcomes the indication by Radebe that the Department of Energy intends to table the IRP for engagement at Nedlac. “We agree with the Minister that the finalisation of the IRP and the Integrated Energy Plan are vital for policy certainty in the energy sector,” Busa CEO Tanya Cohen said. Busa has been consistent in its position that an updated IRP requires evidence and consultation to ensure that the plan is sustainable, affordable and geared towards inclusive growth. An updated IRP is required to place South Africa’s energy policy on a sustainable footing, and will provide the foundation for higher levels of economic growth, Busa said.
