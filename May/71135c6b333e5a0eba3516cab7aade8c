The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) has signed a landmark memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Green Building Council of South Africa (GBCSA). With smart urbanism and sustainability the overall theme at this year’s Rics Summit Africa, the MoU represents a commitment by both organisations to work closer together in promoting sustainable development in the built environment arena in Africa. With rapid urbanisation in Africa and challenges around climate change, green building and developing more sustainable cities has gained momentum and more significance. “It is great to sign this MoU with the GBCSA as it represents yet another important partnership for Rics on the continent. Green building and sustainability has become an important part of the built environment sector globally.” “Both Rics and the GBCSA are important players in this space, so working together makes sense,” said Rics South Africa country manager TC Chetty. GBCSA CE Dorah Modise commented that the MoU is of significance to the GBCSA as it sees sustainability in the built environment sector as a joint initiative. “Rics is a global industry organisation and collaboration is crucial if we want to achieve greater strides in sustainability.”
