Bread producer Albany has reopened its bakery in Virginia, in the Free State, following a R70-million refurbishment. The new bakery will initially operate for 12 hours a day, across two shifts, with plans to eventually increase output to full capacity, baking for 24 hours a day, across three shifts. The bakery will produce Albany’s core products under the Superior white and brown ranges. The refurbished bakery features a new bread cooler, Baker Perkins moulders, slicers, baggers and mixers. “We are excited for the factory’s revival, which will not only deliver fresh loaves daily, but also provide jobs, uplift the community and drive new opportunities,” MD Matshela Seshibe said in a statement on Thursday. Albany Bakery Virginia currently works with 22 local suppliers that provide raw materials, engineering spares and safety equipment. “This investment will benefit our suppliers by increasing their turnover, and create additional employment in the Virginia area. As we open 17 new routes with 625 new outlets, and penetrate new geographical areas, more drivers and van assistants will be employed,” he said.
