Mine dewatering equipment supplier Weir Minerals won the 2018 Most Transformed Company of the Year Award, as well as the Environment Stewardship Award, at the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa (Seifsa) Awards for Excellence, on Thursday night. Engineering support services company Babcock won the Health and Safety Award for the company with the lowest lost-time injury frequency rate. The company completed a 1.5-million man hour project without any serious injuries. Computer software support provider Denwa Engineering won the Most Innovative Award category, for its MaMoo Trailer, which is used to design and manufacture a product with local material and labour, instead of importing from an overseas-based company with very little value-add from South Africa. The Best Corporate Social Responsibility Programme of the Year Award was won by automation and energy management multinational Schneider Electric, which not only complied with legislative and any requirements, but also gave back to society in a manner that creates a lasting impact. The Association of the Year Award went to the Light Engineering Industries Association of South Africa for its continued active participation in the various structures within Seifsa, the Metal Engineering Industries Bargaining Council and the Metal Industries Benefit Funds, as well as other related Trustee Committees. Gibela Rail Transport Consortium was declared winner of the Company of the Year Award for having the highest spend on services provided by Seifsa throughout its divisions. This year, the Student of the Year Award was scooped by Moses Negoma, who is currently employed as a fitter and turner at Rand Water for having been a top student at the Seifsa training centre. “Seifsa maintains that it is critically important for those companies which excel at what they do to get the acknowledgement and recognition they deserve from industry peers,” Seifsa CEO Kaizer Nyatsumba said at the ceremony.
