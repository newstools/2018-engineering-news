International business aviation company ExecuJet, which is part of the Luxaviation Group, on Tuesday announced a strategic alliance for maintenance services between its Lagos-based maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility and Nigeria-based Izy Air. This forms part of ExecuJet’s ongoing development plan in West Africa, with the company aiming to support growth of business aviation in the region with the provision of class-leading original-equipment manufactures and avionics maintenance services. ExecuJet’s customers will now benefit from preferential rates and extensive MRO offerings, with support now being offered in Abuja, Nigeria. “Our MRO facility in Lagos is going from strength to strength, and the run of investments we have seen over the past year have succeeded in making ExecuJet the go-to maintenance provider in the region,” says ExecuJet Africa VP Gavin Kiggen. He added that as a result of the new agreement with local operator Izy Air, the company looks forward to extending its competitive pricing, quality service and “unsurpassed safety standards to an ever-growing number of customers”. Izy Air president Alex Izinyon II mentioned Izy Air’s delight in announcing the strategic alliance between the company and ExecuJet. “Through this alliance, Izy Air will continue to offer its world class charter and management services with the support of the ExecuJet team in aircraft maintenance services. The building of this symbiotic relationship will allow us to better serve our clients in the region,” he said. ExecuJet, which manages 165 business jets globally, has operations in six regions – Africa, the Americas, Asia-Pacific, the Caribbean, Europe and the Middle East – and employs more than 1 000 people.
