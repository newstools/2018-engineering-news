Aeronautics company Airbus has hired logistics service provider Imperial Logistics to procure and distribute metal cutting tools such as milling cutters, drills and countersinks for its German production facilities. Imperial Logistics acts as a service provider for Airbus and manages the procurement and logistics as far as the point of use for all aircraft models within the factories at Stade, Bremen, Donauwörth and Hamburg, in Germany. “Thanks to our concept, Airbus has been able to significantly improve the processes for supplying tools within its factories,” says Imperial Logistics International CEO Carsten Taucke. Imperial Logistics manages the suppliers and does not just act as the interface, but is also responsible for the complete operational purchasing process within the supply chain. A systems, applications and production implementation environment system has been developed to manage the procedures. The handling operations are managed at the Imperial Logistics business locations in Hamburg and Bavaria.
