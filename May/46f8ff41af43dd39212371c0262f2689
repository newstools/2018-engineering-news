The African Development Bank (AfDB) has signed a letter of intent (LoI) with the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (Aims) aimed at identifying opportunities for potential partnership between the two institutions. The organisations will specifically explore ways of strengthening education and research in the mathematical sciences across Africa. The LoI was signed on the sidelines of the AfDB yearly meeting in Busan, Korea, this week. The AfDB and Aims said the LoI signifies the intention to collaborate that will afford opportunities to leverage resources and to develop and strengthen advanced science, technology and innovation skills, as well as the knowledge required to drive the modern economy in Africa. AfDB agriculture, human and social development VP Dr Jennifer Blanke joined Aims president and CEO Thierry Zomahoun as signatories. Blanke said mathematics and science play a critical role in the promotion of human development and innovation in Africa. The bank and the institute said a possible outcome from the LoI signing could be the establishment of an AfDB-Aims partnership programme to build expertise in mathematical sciences across Africa. The programme would be tasked with scaling up a strong, young African community of world-class scientists and technologists. Aims said it wants to be the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for Africa. “As we talk about Africa’s transformation, it is not possible without the people,” commented Zomahoun.
