State-owned airline SA Express is charting a new path, since having returned to the skies in August, which is evidenced in the way it has managed to stabilise the business and maintain its operational performance in the past two months. To date, eight of its 18 aircraft have been recertified to return to full business operation. SA Express plans to have 12 aircraft recertified prior to the relaunch of its Cape Town base in January 2019. “Our relaunch strategy is anchored on a new and prudent approach. Instead of trying to be everything to everyone, we have adopted a new model predicated on circumspection in the way we select our routes so that, in the end, we are able to relaunch only on those routes that almost guarantee commercial returns for the airline,” SA Express reported on Monday. So far, the airline has relaunched seven major local and regional routes, including Johannesburg to Lubumbashi, Walvis Bay, Bloemfontein, Kimberley, Richards Bay and Hoedspruit.
