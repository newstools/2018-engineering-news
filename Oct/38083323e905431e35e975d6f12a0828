The City of Cape Town’s bid to use electric buses within its MyCiti system has been stalled by the investigation into former Transport and Urban Development Authority (TDA) commissioner Melissa Whitehead. A fleet of eleven electric buses was scheduled for arrival by the end of 2017, “operating by the beginning of 2018, or sooner”, noted Whitehead in 2017. The buses were to be supplied by China’s BYD, in a R126-million, three-year deal financed by the City of Cape Town. BYD was also required to provide the City of Cape Town with charging stations for the buses, data management systems, spare parts, technical support, training for the bus drivers and mechanical staff, fleet maintenance services, and replacement of the batteries when required. The buses were to travel more than 200 km between charges. The city council, however, voted in January this year to place Whitehead on precautionary suspension pending an investigation into allegations of fraud and tender irregularities, which includes the BYD tender.

“We can only take delivery of the buses on conclusion of the current ongoing investigation, and pending the outcome thereof,” City of Cape Town spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo tells Engineering News Online. “The investigation is expected to be finalised before the end of the year.
 
“As with all council-approved investigations, this process is independent and must be permitted to run its course.
 
“Once the investigation and disciplinary have been concluded, the City will be in a position to plan a way forward.”
