Based on a preliminary inspection by State-owned power utility Eskom, it is expected that Unit 5 at the Lethabo power station will remain out of service for a minimum of three months. This follows after the death of one employee and the injury of another at the power station on Wednesday when the live steam pressure from the boiler at Unit 5 ruptured. Operations continue on other units at the power station. A thorough investigation continues, while counselling has been arranged for employees. “The loss of Unit 5 will have a negative effect on the power system given that Lethabo is one of the most cost-effective generators with adequate access to a steady coal supply. “All efforts will be focused on the safe and swift return of this unit to the national grid," said Eskom CEO Pakamani Hadebe.
