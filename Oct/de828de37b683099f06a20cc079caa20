Industrial group enX’s board of directors has completed a strategic review of its ownership interest in its fleet management business, Eqstra Fleet Management and Logistics (EFML), and believes the business may be better suited under a different structure to optimise EFML’s value proposition. Accordingly, enX has started a process which may result in the divestment of EFML in whole or in part.
