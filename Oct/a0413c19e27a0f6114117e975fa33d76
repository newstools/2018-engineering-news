Road building company Eurovia and its parent Vinci have laid a kilometre of motorway using only recycled asphalt from a mobile plant, a world first that they said could help reduce the cost of motorway maintenance and cut pollution. The mobile recycling plant can be disassembled and moved along the highway as the works progress. The plant "makes it possible to recycle up to 100% of asphalt aggregates nearby road maintenance sites," Vinci said in a statement. "This development represents significant progress compared with the current recycling rates of 50% to 60%." The pilot test was carried out on the A10 which links Paris and the southwestern city of Bordeaux.
