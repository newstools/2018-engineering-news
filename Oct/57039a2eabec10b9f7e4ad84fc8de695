Research and consulting firm Intellidex has appointed Peter Attard Montalto head of capital markets research, to expand its depth of research and widen its client base among global investors. Montalto will lead Intellidex’s coverage of economics, politics and fixed income markets in South Africa and the rest of the sub-Saharan Africa region. “He brings a strong fixed income competency to complement the firm’s existing equities research capability,” said Intellidex executive chairperson Dr Stuart Theobald. “With so much going on now in South Africa in the run up to the 2019 election, an independent offshore perspective is more valuable than ever to investors and other decision-makers. “The rest of the continent is also at a key junction given increased indebtedness in an environment of tightening global liquidity, with China and the International Monetary Fund set to play a complex role in the future of those economies,” commented Montalto. Intellidex has expanded its global operations by establishing an office in Boston under the leadership of Dr Graunt Kruger who heads Intellidex’s financial services strategy consulting. Montalto added capacity in Intellidex’s London office, while supporting the capital markets team in Johannesburg.
