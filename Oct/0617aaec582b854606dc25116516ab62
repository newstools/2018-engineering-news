The Rexroth HUBB, in Kempton Park, was officially inaugurated on Thursday. The 16 000 m2 central hub houses the Bosch Rexroth South Africa group of companies, formerly the Hytec Group. Six group companies – Hytec, Tectra Automation, Hytec Services Africa, HYSA, Hagglunds and Bosch Rexroth Africa – completed their relocation to this new facility in mid-June. The facility now encompasses centralised production, training facilities, engineering, sales and support offices, and bears the acronym HUBB – Hytec Unified by Bosch. Sharing the premises with Bosch Rexroth’s South African product development and support division underlines the Hytec group and Bosch Rexroth partnership of more than 50 years, and increases the proximity between Bosch Rexroth’s research and development and manufacturing centres in Germany, and its 40 branches across Africa. This will also facilitate and enhance the company’s services and support to the continent, which is considered a significant market for growth. The company invested over R200-million in this new facility. The facility is strategically located in close proximity to OR Tambo International Airport. This consolidated facility will also allow the company to reduce the amount of intralogical transactions, thereby streamlining its handling efficiency to supply its technology to market with increased speed. Further to allowing the group to consolidate its internal business activities, the investment also underlines the company’s commitment and belief in South Africa, and the growth of its industrial business. This sentiment was emphasised at the launch, where the HUBB was unveiled in a ribbon cutting ceremony attended by Bosch Rexroth executives, and official representatives from Germany and South Africa.
