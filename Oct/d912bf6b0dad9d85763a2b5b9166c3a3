Despite South Africa having experienced subpar economic growth in the last decade, financial services firm Citibank economist Gina Schoeman believes this year has marked a positive turning point for the country. While the country's gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected to be only 0.8% this year, she pointed out that a slightly-above 1% growth is on the cards for 2019, with GDP growth expected to reach growth levels of just below 2% in 2020. “It does improve, but it depends on whether this is real sufficient growth to make people feel better, because otherwise you’re going to see that start to weigh on policy decisions,” she warned. While the country is in a tough position at the moment, with an extremely weak outlook, she explained to Engineering News Online that the change in direction in the economy stems from monetary policy, the political cycle, as well as how it will be approached going forward. The turning point will also have an impact on the socioeconomic environment in South Africa, which has seen an “internal economic demise” between 2012 and 2017 owing to a low GDP growth. “ . . . global cycles matter a lot to us, but 2012 was the first real internal shift in South Africa when the labour problems started. That’s also when the downgrade cycle started,” she said. She stressed that South Africa has become dependent on consumers to drive the economy, while consumers' income is limited, more so than ever before. “This is because [South Africa] hasn’t had sufficient growth for a whole decade. This has led to a loss of confidence; from both businesses and consumers."
