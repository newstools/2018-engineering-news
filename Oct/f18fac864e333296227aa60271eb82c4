Precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater, the West Rand Development Agency, the Gauteng Infrastructure Financing Agency and the Far West Rand Dolomitic Water Association (FWRDWA) have issued a request for qualification (RfQ) for a suitability qualified programme manager for the multistakeholder Bokamoso Ba Rona Initiative. The multistakeholder initiative, which was launched in September, is aimed at promoting sustainable economic activity through the development of a large industrial and bio-energy hub, in areas on the greater West Rand district, where local economies are currently predominantly dependent on mining. Sibanye-Stillwater, the Merafong municipality and FWRDWA will set aside about 30 000 ha of land in the programme area to facilitate the development of this hub in Gauteng. Interested respondents can find the RfQ and pertinent information at www.sibanyestillwater.com, www.gifa.co.za, and www.wrdm.gov.za. The deadline for submissions is November 2 at 15:00. An information session will be held at 10:00 on October 12 at Sibanyeâ€™s academy in Glenharvie for potential respondents to obtain clarifications.
