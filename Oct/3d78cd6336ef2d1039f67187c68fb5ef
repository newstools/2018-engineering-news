Eskom has placed its senior GM of assurance and forensics Molefi Nkhabu on a precautionary suspension pending an investigation into circumstances surrounding internal audit investigation reports pertaining to transactions that he signed off on, which contain inferences or conclusions which had the effect of exonerating certain previous Eskom executives implicated in maladministration.
 
"The Eskom executive management, while espousing the principle of the presumption of innocence, due to the seniority of Nkhabu and the seriousness of the allegations made against him, took a decision that it would be better for him to be suspended until the investigation is finalised.
 
"The board and executive management of Eskom are keen and resolute in rooting out maladministration," the utility said in a statement issued on Thursday.
