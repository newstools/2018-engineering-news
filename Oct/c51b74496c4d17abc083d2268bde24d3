Construction company Concor Buildings has been awarded a contract for the construction of Illovo Central – a 17-storey mixed-use development near Sandton that is due for completion in January 2020. This is the second of four planned mixed-use buildings planned for the Illovo precinct that is being developed by FWJK. The scope of work for Illovo Central comprises the construction of the building and its basement parking, as well as the associated earthworks, lateral support, minor public road upgrades and related external work. The structure’s footprint spans almost 18 000 m2. Concor contracts director Fanie Stadler said Illovo Central would be built using the latest materials and building techniques and would meet the highest environmental standards. As a mixed-use project, it will comprise 152 sectional title apartments – ranging in size from 22 m2 studio apartments to 651 m2 four-bedroom penthouse apartments – as well as commercial and retail space, restaurants and an executive rest centre. Illovo Central is close to both the Sandton and Rosebank Gautrain stations. “With the Illovo node in an exponential growth phase, this addition to the skyline will share the highest elevation in the greater Sandton area with Illovo Point,” noted Stadler.
