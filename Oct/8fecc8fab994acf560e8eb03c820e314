Mazda will deploy some form of electrification in all of its production vehicles by 2030. The Japanese car maker expects internal combustion engines, combined with some form of electrification, such as plug-in hybrids, to account for 95% of the vehicles it produces by 2030, and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) for 5% of all vehicles. The manufacturer says it will develop its electric vehicles in-house. Mazda will develop two BEVs. One will be powered solely by battery, while another will pair a battery with a newly developed range extender powered by “Mazda’s small, lightweight and exceptionally quiet rotary engine”. The range extender will recharge the battery when necessary, effectively increasing the vehicle’s driving range. The concept behind the rotary-powered range extender is to leverage the rotary engine’s small size and high power output to enable multiple electrification technology solutions. Taking advantage of the rotary engine’s compatibility with gaseous fuels, the design of the rotary-powered range extender is such that it can also burn liquefied petroleum gas and provide a source of electricity in emergencies. Mazda says its new electrification strategy will assist the company in achieving a 90% reduction (versus 2010 levels) in its average well-to-wheel carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.
