President Cyril Ramaphosa will make a statement on the fate of Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene on Tuesday at 16:30, his office said, sending the rand firmer. Nene is facing calls to resign after he admitted to visiting the Gupta brothers, friends of scandal-plagued former leader Jacob Zuma who have been accused of corruption, and failed to disclose the meetings earlier. Zuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing.
