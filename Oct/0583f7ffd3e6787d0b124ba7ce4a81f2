Luxury aviation company ExecuJet will, on October 25, officially launch and welcome the Pilatus PC-24 to its fleet at the company’s private terminal at Cape Town International Airport. The aircraft, which was developed by Swiss original-equipment manufacturer Pilatus, is the first of its type delivered to South Africa, and on the African continent, ExecuJet Africa VP Gavin Kiggen tells Engineering News Online. The PC-24 does not fit into any of the existing business jet categories, he explains, which is why Pilatus created a new one – the super versatile jet category. The PC-24 has been engineered to be “off-road” compatible from the beginning, with “outstanding” short-field performance, even on unpaved runways. This, Kiggen says, affords the plane an “incredible level of mobility”. The aircraft delivers the latest in in-flight comfort and technology for passengers, which Kiggen notes cements ExecuJet’s reputation for having a modern and capable charter fleet. The Pilatus PC-24 combines the versatility of a turboprop with the cabin size of a medium-light jet, and the performance of a light jet. Considering that production of the aircraft only began last year, Kiggen tells Engineering News Online that the initial order book for the PC-24 was sold out within a matter of days after being launched. The fourteenth aircraft will be delivered to the client soon. The first customer delivery took place in February. “From what we know, South Africa will see a handful of PC-24’s and we will be engaging with the various owners to place their aircraft under management with ExecuJet,” Kiggen says, adding that although the aircraft will be based in Cape Town, the aircraft can be positioned to service clients wherever required.
