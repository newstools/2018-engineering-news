On Thursday, thousands of Solidary Movement members will serve court papers on integrated energy and chemicals company Sasol at its head office in Sandton. The serving of the court documents comes in the wake of a dispute between Sasol and Solidarity over the exclusion of white employees from the Khanyisa employee share scheme. Solidarity will ask the Labour Court to find that the total exclusion of a particular group of employees, based on their race, amounts to unfair discrimination. Solidarity members embarked on a strike at Sasol at the beginning of September. According to Solidary CE Dr Dirk Hermann, Solidarity members gave the union a mandate to intensify the action at Sasol. This led to the decision to stage a protest march and go to court.

“It is a pity that we have to go to court about something that so obviously cannot be morally justified. The total exclusion of any group of employees can never be justified,” Hermann said. 

The greater Solidarity Movement, which also includes AfriForum, Solidarity Helping Hand, the FAK and the School Support Centre, gave its support to this march, according to the statement.

A convoy of busses and cars will depart from the Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria on Thursday morning at 08:00 to Sandton, where a memorandum will be handed over to the JSE, before the convoy proceeds to Sasol’s headquarters. People coming from other places can park at the Rosebank Union Church from 10:00. From there, people will be transported via busses to Mushroom Farm Park in Sandton where the march will begin at 11:00.
