The Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA) has started a series of workshops with registered construction companies in Gauteng and Free State to explain the procurement framework of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) Phase 2 and to share lessons learned from previous tender submissions. The main purpose of the workshops is to improve compliance and participation in the LHWP Phase 2â€™s works. Phase 2 of the LHWP will increase supply from 780-million cubic metres a year to more than 1.26-billion cubic metres a year. Phase Two will be implemented in terms of two distinct components, namely a water delivery system to augment the delivery of water to South Africa and a hydropower generation system, which will increase the current electricity generation capacity in Lesotho.
