Government’s sign-off on the expansion of the Gautrain rail network “is not imminent”, warns Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC Dr Ismail Vadi. He noted on Monday that the feasibility study for the proposed Gauteng Rapid Rail Integrated Network Extension Plan had been completed. This study concluded that the expansion project would provide “significant economic and transport related benefits” to Gauteng. Vadi noted, however, that the Gautrain Management Agency (GMA) was currently engaging National Treasury on “additional revenue models and demand studies” around the project. The GMA also remained in talks with the national Department of Transport steering committee, as well as the Strategic Infrastructure Project 7 steering committee. The Gautrain expansion project, which includes 150 km of additional railway and 19 new stations, proposes new Gautrain lines from Little Falls to Cosmo City to Randburg to Sandton; from Jabulani, in Soweto, to Roodepoort to Little Falls; from Mamelodi to Hazeldean to Irene to Samrand; from Cosmo City to Fourways to Sunninghill to Olievenhoutbosch to Samrand; from Marlboro to Modderfontein to Rhodesfield to OR Tambo International Airport’s new proposed Midfield Terminal; and from Rhodesfield to East Rand Mall to Boksburg.
