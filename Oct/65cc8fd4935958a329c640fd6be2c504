Turkey will introduce quotas on the amount of steel it imports from Oct. 17, with an additional 25% duty on any imports above the quotas, it said in a filing published by the World Trade Organization on Monday, blaming a surge in imports. It said it had begun investigating the case for emergency "safeguard" measures in April, after US President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on steel. That, and subsequent trade restrictions in other countries, including the European Union, India and Indonesia, had diverted steel towards Turkey.
