The South African new-vehicle market declined by 1.9% in September, to 49 670 units, compared with the same month last year. The newest sales numbers, released on Monday, indicated that September new-passenger car sales decreased by 2.6%, to reach 32 786 units. Sales of new bakkies, minibuses and vans, at 14 342 units, declined by 1.2%. Sales of medium trucks, at 702 units, inched up by 0.4%. Sales of new heavy trucks and buses also delivered some positive results, increasing by 4.7%, to 1 840 units. Both of these segments recorded growth for the third month in a row. Export sales reached a new record in September, gaining 1.2%, to reach 36 781 units. The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa warned in a statement that consumers’ disposable income, already under pressure, would be further impacted by the record fuel price increases announced for October. “Ongoing weakness in purchasing managers’ indices, as well as the Reserve Bank’s leading indicator, suggest that business conditions and the general trading environment will remain difficult over the next six to nine months,” noted the association. “With three quarters of 2018 accounted for, indications are that [new-vehicle] sales in all major segments, on an annualised basis, will probably register marginal declines compared with the previous year. Exports are expected to reach 340 000 units this year, up from the 329 000 units recorded last year. Top-selling cars, bakkies and vans in September:
