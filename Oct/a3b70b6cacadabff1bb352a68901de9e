The final purchase consideration for JSE-listed Long4Lifeâ€™s acquisition of beverage producer, packer and distributer Chill Holdings, amounted to R481-million, the company announced on Monday. This amount was based on actual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of R92-million, achieved by Chill for the financial year ended June 30. Of the R481-million, 75% was settled in cash and 25% in Long4Life ordinary shares. When first announcing the transaction in November 2017, Long4Life described Chill as a Western Cape-based producer, packer and distributor of a range of beverages, with storage and distribution facilities located in major cities across South Africa. The acquisition, the company said, boasted a fully integrated in-house business platform from product conception and development, through production to sales and marketing.
