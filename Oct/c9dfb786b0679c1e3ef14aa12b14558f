State-owned Transnet has started preparation work on the reconstruction of the accumulator tanks at the Island View precinct in the Port of Durban, with the project expected to get under way in 2019. The project plan for the reconstruction of the tanks is currently at a feasibility phase, with construction expected to be completed in 2023. The ten existing tanks in the precinct belonging to Transnet, which were built in 2012 and have not passed integrity testing, will be dismantled. "The construction of the new tanks will ensure that petroleum products are handled safely, efficiently and at higher volumes," Transnet said on Thursday. It assured consumers that the reconstruction of the tanks would not impact on the security of fuel supply in the country.
