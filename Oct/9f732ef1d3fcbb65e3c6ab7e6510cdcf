The City of Cape Town on Monday announced that dam levels feeding the city had improved to 76,2 percent of storage capacity over the past week. Dam levels rose only slightly by 0,3 percent over the last week to 76,2 percent of storage capacity, while the average water consumption for the past week increased from 520-million to 546-million litres per day. Level 5 water restrictions and tariffs are in place and were lowered from Level 6 as an interim measure to provide some relief to residents after a drought described as the worst in more than a century. “For now, Cape Town must do its very best to remain in the lower 500-million litres per day usage band until another limit is imposed by the national department of water and sanitation. This is likely to happen in December. The permitted usage under Level 5 restrictions is 70 litres per person per day,” the statement said.
