The board of directors of Europe-based major global aerospace manufacturing group Airbus announced on Monday that it had chosen Guillaume Faury as its next CEO. Faury is currently President of Airbus Commercial Aircraft. He will replace incumbent group CEO Tom Enders in April next year. Faury was appointed CEO of Airbus Commercial Aircraft early last year. Before that, starting in May 2013, he had been CEO of Airbus Helicopters. He had spent most of the past 20 years in the aerospace industry, except for some four years (2009-2013) with Peugeot (as Executive VP for Research and Development). He was with Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters) from 1998 to 2008, in a variety of senior management posts. “We have diligently prepared for this succession, reaching a unanimous conclusion after a thorough examination of all potential candidates, internal and external,” reported Airbus board chairman Denis Ranque. “We are delighted to be appointing someone of Guillaume’s calibre to take the helm.” “I am honoured to have been selected by the board to lead this extraordinary company,” said Faury. “I look forward to taking on this new challenge with passion and enthusiasm, relying on the exceptional expertise and engagement of all Airbus people around the world.” “Guillaume is an excellent choice,” affirmed Enders. “He has gained broad industrial and aeronautic experience over many years and in many roles both inside and outside Airbus. With his strong values and international mindset, Guillaume stands for the new generation of leaders that Airbus needs for the coming decade. He knows he can rely on me to facilitate a smooth transition.” In 2016, Airbus adopted a policy of having a staggered board succession process. Under this, Ranque will remain as chairman until April 2020, when, at his own request, he will stand down. The process of replacing him will start in due time and in accord with the group’s policy of ensuring international diversity in management and on the board.
