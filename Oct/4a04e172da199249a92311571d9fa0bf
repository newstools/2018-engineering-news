Luxury aviation company ExecuJet on Monday welcomed the first Pilatus PC-24 aircraft in Africa to its premises at Lanseria International Airport, in Johannesburg.

ExecuJet, which held a photo opportunity on Monday, is the first business aviation company in Africa to operate and manage a Pilatus Aircraft PC-24.

With the aircraft to be based at the Cape Town International Airport, ExecuJet will be responsible for its day-to-day management and operations on behalf of the aircraft owner.

Developed by Swiss original-equipment manufacturer Pilatus, the PC-24 is flexible and has the ability to operate in and out of very short and unpaved runways.

The PC-24 will also be available for charter and offers clients the latest in in-flight entertainment and connectivity.

The PC-24â€™s interior has combined comfort and functionality, with each component having been carefully chosen to enhance the passenger experience. Components include soft leathers and hardwood cabinetry, which create a bespoke interior that reflects a meticulous design.

The generously-sized cabin boasts a continuous flat floor, and allows for exceptional headroom for both passengers and crew.

With six passengers, departing Cape Town, the aircraft can reach Angola, Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique.

Passengers will also be able to reach the Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Kenya and Mauritius from ExecuJet's fixed-base operator at Lanseria.

ExecuJet, meanwhile, looks forward to officially welcoming the aircraft to its fleet later this month.
