A Lagos judge adjourned a hearing on Tuesday in a $10.1-billion dispute between South African telecoms firm MTN Group and Nigeria's central bank to Dec 4. The central bank alleges the firm illegally sent $8.1-billion abroad, and the Nigerian government has demanded $2-billion in taxes from MTN. MTN, which makes about a third of its annual core profit in Nigeria, has said the allegations are without merit.
