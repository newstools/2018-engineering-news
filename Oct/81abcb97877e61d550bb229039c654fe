Eskom nonexecutive director George Sebulela has resigned, effective immediately, chairperson Jabu Mabuza confirmed on Friday. Sebulela resigned after considering legal advice on his continued role as an Eskom director after the board was made aware of certain conflicts of interest. Mabuza said Sebulela made the right decision to resign and to help ensure that acceptable standards of good corporate governance are maintained. Mabuza also dismissed allegations that other directors had also resigned from the board.
