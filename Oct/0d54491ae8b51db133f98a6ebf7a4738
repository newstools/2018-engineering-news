The South African Revenue Service (Sars) has been allocated R1.4-billion over the medium term for recapitalisation, following "serious governance failures" as found by the commission of inquiry into tax administration and governance. The governance failures have led to revenuue shortfalls. In 2017/18, for the first time since 2008, tax revenue growth did not exceed gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Revenue collections in 2017/18 were R800-million lower than the estimated 2018 Budget. Revenue shortfalls have widened over the past four years, with under-collections rising from R7.4-billion in 2014//15 to R49-billion in 2017/18. These shortfalls would have been larger, were it not for increases in personal income, dividend withholding, capital gains and other taxes. Sars reforms, which include regularising value-added tax (VAT) refunds and rebuilding enforcement capacity, are under way . The Medium Term Budget Policy Statement, released on Wednesday, admitted that there has been fiscal slippage since the 2018 Budget, with tax revenues being revised down by R27-billion in 2018/19, owing to higher VAT refunds. Sars acting commissioner Mark Kingon on Wednesday questioned whether it was the outcome of incompetence or if Sars might have intentionally withheld tax. “Whether it was done intentionally or not is open for debate, but categorically it is wrong nonetheless and the refunds need to be paid. That money is due to the taxpayer. The disbursement back to the taxpayer can, in turn, be injected back into the economy.” Tax revenue is further revised down by R24.7-billion in 2019/20 but is expected to increase by R33-billion in 2020/21. At this stage, revenue projections assume no changes to tax rates, but provide for yearly adjustments to personal income tax brackets, levies and excise duties in line with inflation. A backlog of VAT refunds at Sars, and an underestimation of refunds due, has led to an overly optimistic view of revenue growth. Net VAT collections account for about R20-billion of the in-year revenue shortfall. The VAT refund estimate has been revised upwards by R9-billion, and about R11-billion will be paid out to clear the backlog in the VAT credit book. Despite spending pressures materialising, the expenditure ceiling remains intact as the anchor of fiscal policy. The consolidated budget deficit narrows from 4.2% in 2019/20, to 4% in 2021/22. Gross debt is expected to stabilise at 59.6% of GDP in 2023/24. Currency depreciation accounts for about 70% of the upward revision to gross loan debt in the current year. GDP grew by 0.6% in the first half of this year, compared with the same period in 2017. However, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP fell in the first half of the year, leading to a declared technical recession. The National Treasury forecasts that GDP growth should rise to 1.7% in 2019, 2.1% in 2020 and 2.3% by 2021. Inflation is expected to remain within the 3% to 6% target band over the medium term, despite pressure from a weaker exchange rate and higher oil prices.
