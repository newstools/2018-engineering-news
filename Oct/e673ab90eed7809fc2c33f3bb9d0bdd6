Nigeriaâ€™s central bank governor, Godwin Emefiele, will meet with MTN Group and four banks on Tuesday amid a dispute over $8.1-billion that the bank said was transferred illegally out of the country, two people familiar with the situation said. The people declined to be identified because the information has not been made public. Lagos-based Business Day reported the meeting earlier.
