Eskom announced on Thursday afternoon that it had placed its Senior General Manager of Assurance and Forensics, Molefi Nkhabu, on a precautionary suspension. The power utility said this was pending an investigation into circumstances surrounding internal audit investigation reports related to transactions that he signed off on. The reports contain “inferences or conclusions which had the effect of exonerating certain previous Eskom executives implicated in maladministration”. It did not say which previous executives it was referring to, or when the investigation into Nkhabu would start. “The Eskom executive management, whilst espousing the principle of the presumption of innocence, due to the seniority of Mr Nkhabu and the seriousness of the allegations made against him, took a decision that it would be better for him to be suspended until the investigation is finalised,” the group said in a statement. “The Board and executive management of Eskom are keen and resolute in rooting out maladministration. “
