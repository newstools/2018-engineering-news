The Department of Defence (DoD) will, on Friday, host a supplier day in Centurion, during which the department aims to build relationships with small, medium-sized and microenterprises (SMMEs). The department will also be sharing details of its procurement processes with SMMEs. Limited free exhibition stalls are available on a first come, first served basis for SMMEs to showcase their services and potential exhibitors are required to register for the exhibition. Registrations can be completed through faxing or emailing a company letterhead, along with details regarding the type of products and services the company renders, contact person and full contact details, as well as the preference for an indoor or outdoor stall. SMMEs that are not assigned exhibition stalls are still welcome to attend the exhibition; however, they will need to register before the day of the event by sending a contact person’s name, surname, ID number and email address to rsvp@tsalena.co.za, or faxing the details to 072 488 6125.
