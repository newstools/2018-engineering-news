Astron Energy, previously Chevron South Africa (CSA), has appointed Mashudu Ramano chairperson and Jonathan Molapo CEO, with immediate effect. CSA was, last month, acquired by black economic empowerment consortium Off The Shelf Investments, which is chaired by Ramano, for $1-billion. Ramano is the founder of several companies, including African Legend Investments, Legend Power Solutions, Ramano & Associates, Terracotta Resources, WWE Resources Solutions and Mitochondria Energy Company. He also serves on the boards of the Avon and Dedisa Peaking Power companies, which own two peaking power plants with more than 1 000 MW of energy-generation capacity. Previously, he served as chairperson on the boards of several companies including Airports Company South Africa, Johnnic Communications, African Harvest, Trade & Investment Limpopo, Platinum Trust of South Africa (North West province), Small Enterprise Development Agency, Domba Trust and as nonexecutive director of Transnet, Johnnic Industrial Holdings, Coronation Holdings and Delta Electrical Industries. Molapo, meanwhile, has over 20 years’ experience in the petroleum sector, most recently as CEO of Africa at Puma Energy Holdings. Prior to joining Puma Energy, he spent 20 years with Total in several leadership roles including executive VP for East & Central Africa (2011); MD of Total Petroleum Ghana (2008); GM of Total South Africa (2005); and MD and CEO of Total Commercial Services (2003). He is also a nonexecutive director of AECI. “It gives me great pleasure to announce the appointment of a South African of Jon’s pedigree to lead our business. The board of Astron Energy looks forward to working with Jon and his management team to implement our vision for the company,” Ramano said on Tuesday.
