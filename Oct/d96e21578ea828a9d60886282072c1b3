An unexpected surge in demand will see Brink Towing Systems South Africa (SA) in October and November export almost 10 000 additional units to its parent company, the Brink Group, in the Netherlands. Brink Towing Systems SA is the largest manufacturer of tow bars in the domestic market, and supplies the Ford plant, in Pretoria, as well as the Toyota plant, in Durban. “Brink has a global network of manufacturing facilities, so it is an achievement for Pietermaritzburg to be chosen, despite South Africa’s comparatively high steel costs,” says Brink Towing Systems SA MD Mark Gutridge. “We have always been flexible in terms of our production process and pride ourselves in our ability to quickly go from a run of one type of bar, to another. Our adaptability was key in this case.” A recent upgrade to the local operation, including the installation of a twin six-axis Yaskawa welding robot, has managed to reduce production time per unit. The robot’s sophisticated circuitry allows it to be pre-programmed to carry out complex welding sequences with remarkable accuracy, speed and quality, explains Gutridge. “Whilst close to half the total [Netherlands] order comprises a bar of one type, there will be a total of nine different types in the mix, which requires careful planning from a production and materials perspective. “In the meantime, we’ll also be continuing with our normal high-volume orders for the Ford Ranger and Toyota,” notes Gutridge. The Pietermaritzburg Brink plant has a production capacity of 120 000 units a year, while the Brink Group, which has plants in the UK, Holland and France, produces more than one-million towbars a year.
