From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: A South African inventor has developed a new flexible wing, which he believes could have application in everything from wind energy and sailing to aviation and motoring. Sashnee Moodley: Inspired, in part, by the flight of the Cape Vulture, South African architect-turned-inventor Robert Bray has developed a morphing wing concept, which he has now patented internationally. With support from engineering group WorleyParsons, the wing has been applied to a vertical-axis wind turbine, which could become an alternative to rooftop-solar in the embedded generation market. The turbine has been tested by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which has wind tunnel facilities at its campus in Pretoria. Brayfoil founder Robert Bray and WorleyParsons CEO Denver Dreyer talk to us about the wing concept, the development of the wind turbine and prospects for commercialisation.
