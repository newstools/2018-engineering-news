The Department of Water and Sanitation plans to appoint contractors for the roads and advanced works for the Nwamitwa dam, in Limpopo, in March 2020, ahead of the appointment of a contractor for the construction of the dam in March 2022, Water and Sanitation Minister Gugile Nkwinti said in a Parliamentary reply published this week. In response to questions by the Democratic Alliance (DA), Nkwinti said the appointment of these contractors is subject to the availability of funding and the finalisation of certain land matters. The Nwamitwa dam will be built downstream of the confluence of the Greater Letaba and Nwanedzi rivers. It is expected to be completed in 2026 at a cost of R4.6-billion. It is envisaged that a dam at the Nwamitwa site will have a storage capacity of 187-million cubic metres and will increase the firm yield from the river system for domestic use by 14-million cubic metres a year
