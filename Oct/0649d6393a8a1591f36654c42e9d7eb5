In line with Germany-based lighting and electronics specialist HELLA’s decision to position its sub-Saharan African operations to serve as a gateway into Africa, HELLA Automotive South Africa (HELLA SA) will build a new R30-million operations hub in zone two of the Coega special economic zone (SEZ). HELLA SA’s operations office is currently situated in Uitenhage, in the Eastern Cape, but the company believes the move to its new facility will strengthen its operations, catering for both the administration and logistics operations under one roof. HELLA SA is set to start operating out of its new facility by mid-2019. With HELLA’s stronghold and linkages within the automotive industry, it makes sense to neighbour with some of the biggest automotive companies in South Africa, such as First Automotive Works and Beijing Automotive International Corporation South Africa, which are situated in, or near, the Coega SEZ. “Already today, HELLA SA has a comprehensive spare parts range spanning more than 40 000 products of which 5 000 are stocked items. With the new facility, HELLA aims to increase its local stock holding with their much larger facilities and operational enhancements,” says HELLA SA MD Theo Theuner.
