The US Federal Trade Commission said on Monday that it will require Praxair and Linde to divest assets in nine industrial gases product markets in United States, as part of a settlement that resolves charges that their proposed merger would likely be anticompetitive. The assets will be sold to companies including Messer Group and Matheson Tri-Gas, the FTC said.
