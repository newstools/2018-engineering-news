The Board of Directors of South Africa’s Air Traffic and Navigation Services (ATNS), the State-owned company responsible for the country’s air traffic control, announced on Wednesday that it had appointed an interim CEO for the organisation. He is Thomas Kgokolo, who was (before his new appointment) a member of the ATNS Board and of the Audit and Risk Committee. The contract of the previous CEO ended in June, but was then extended for another three months, and has now come to an end. Kgokolo has an MBA from the Gordon Institute of Business Sciences (an institute of the University of Pretoria), a Bachelor of Accounting Sciences Honours degree form the University of South Africa and a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Pretoria. ATNS Board Chairman Simphiwe Thobela hailed Kgokolo as “[a]lways courteous and willing to learn, [and] he is a man of great integrity. Once these specific traits are evident in an individual, it means that a good and perfect choice has been made.” Thobela affirmed that Kgokolo was also ideal for the post because of “his concern for safety and his vision on how it may be addressed within the industry. He is quite frank about how performance-based targets can be achieved. Secondly, he has shown extreme respect and compassion in what he does and expects to be done.”
