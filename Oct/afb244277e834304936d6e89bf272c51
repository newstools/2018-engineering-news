This was announced at the South African Investment Conference, held in Johannesburg, last week. McDonald’s SA plans to open a further 120 restaurants in the next five years, the capital expenditure of which should positively impact on the construction and manufacturing sectors. “Through this expansion [of restaurants], 7 000 new jobs will be created and we plan to recruit matriculated youths across the country to be employed within our restaurants,” said McDonald’s SA CEO Greg Solomon. Additionally, through McDonald’s SA’s newly planned Hamburger University in Johannesburg, the company will improve more than 12 000 of their employees’ skills.
