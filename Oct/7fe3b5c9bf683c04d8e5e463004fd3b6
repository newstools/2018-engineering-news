Confirmed attendees for next week's South Africa Investment Conference - government's attempt to unlock investment to grow the local economy and create jobs - include JSE listed companies with a market capitalisation of R6.5-trillion and Fortune 500 companies with a market cap of US$4-trillion, government said on Thursday. Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel together with his deputy minister Madala Masuku and presidential economic advisor Trudi Makhaya were briefing journalists on preparations for the conference which takes place at the Sandton Convention Centre from October 25 - 27. Patel said some 800 to 1 000 delegates were expected to attend the conference, about two thirds of them local business people from both large and established companies and emerging investors in South Africa. "We've got some big investors, both globally and locally that will be attending," the minister said. The sectors the conference will focus on are agriculture, agro-processing, mining, energy, transport and water infrastructure, and the creative industries such as film and tourism.
