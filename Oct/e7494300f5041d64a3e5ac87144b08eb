South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Thursday that a gathering of top officials and business leaders had agreed on a package of measures that would create an additional 275 000 jobs a year. Under pressure after the economy slipped into recession this year, Ramaphosa said the measures included boosting local procurement, an export drive and financial sector investments in black-owned industrial enterprises.
