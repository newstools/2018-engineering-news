The Academy of Science of South Africa (ASSAf) has appointed Professor Himla Soodyall executive officer, effective November 1. She will succeed outgoing executive officer Professor Roseanne Diab, who is retiring. Soodyall is a research professor in human genetics at the University of the Witwatersrand and principal medical scientist at the National Health Laboratory Service. In 2017, she was rated as one of the top ten most visible scientists in South Africa in a study by the Centre for Research on Evaluation, Science and Technology at Stellenbosch University. An ASSAf member since 2003, she was elected to the ASSAf council in 2011 and appointed general secretary in 2014 – a position in which she has been active in drafting several strategies promoting young scientists’ activities. “As a highly profiled ambassador for science in South Africa and internationally, Soodyall brings with her experience not only in top-quality research, but also a knowledge of governance and public administration, as well as engagement at all levels of community in Africa and abroad,” the academy said on Monday.
