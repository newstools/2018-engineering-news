Norway, the European Union and several other countries asked the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Thursday to set up a dispute resolution panel to address US tariffs on steel and aluminium, Oslo's foreign minister said. "We believe that US additional duty on steel and aluminium is contrary to WTO rules," Ine Eriksen Soereide told Norwegian news agency NTB. "Therefore, together with the EU and several others, we asked today the WTO to establish a dispute resolution panel on the US additional duty," she added.
