Applications for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) open on Monday, the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Naledi Pandor has announced. Applicants can apply online. Applications for student loans had been suspended owing to a massive backlog, which the ministry said has since been cleared. It cost as much as R1.2-billion to clear the backlog. From Monday applicants can apply online. Once a student has applied to NSFAS, a maximum waiting period before getting a notice of acknowledgement is a week. Should a student not receive any acknowledgement of their application, they are requested to call NSFAS’s TOLL FREE Call centre, on 08000 NSFAS (67327).
