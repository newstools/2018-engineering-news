The Franchise Association of South Africa (Fasa) has partnered with Proudly SA to increase the local procurement of goods and services within the franchising sector by facilitating collaboration between suppliers, franchisors and franchisees. This joint enterprise development initiative was pursued after Fasa identified the need for transformation in the franchise industry, owing to the size of the sector and its contribution to the country’s gross domestic product. The franchise sector is growing every year and presents a viable investment model, and it is ideal to grow local procurement. Owing to Proudly SA’s strict vetting processes, it is expected that franchise businesses can be assured of procurement from a reputable supplier. Proudly SA seeks to strongly influence local procurement in the public and private sectors, to increase local production, influence consumers to buy local and stimulate job creation.
