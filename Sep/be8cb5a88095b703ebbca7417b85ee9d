The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) has transferred R30-million to Rand Water for the War on Leaks (WoL) programme. The DWS noted in a statement on Tuesday that the money will assist Rand Water, as the implementing agent, to effect stipend payments to trainees. Water and Sanitation Minister Gugile Nkwinti has further given instruction that the necessary funding has to be found within the DWS budget to ensure that the WoL programme reaches finality. Started in 2015, the WoL initiative is aimed at assisting municipalitiesâ€™ operations and maintenance efforts to ensure the municipal infrastructure does not fall into further decay. Trainees will hopefully be absorbed into affected municipalities.
