Transnet Engineering has appointed Thoba Majoka acting chief officer for advanced manufacturing, effective September 10. Majoka is currently the divisional executive for maintenance and services at Transnet Engineering, where he is responsible for the overall strategic direction of this particular division. This follows the decision by the Transnet board to suspend Transnet Engineering chief officer for advanced manufacturing Thamsanqa Jiyane, after he was implicated in multiple investigations commissioned by the board, primarily the awarding of the 1 064 locomotives acquisition tender. At a special meeting last week, the board considered Jiyane’s representations as to why he should not be suspended and concluded that the representations were implausible and that Jiyane’s continued presence at Transnet is likely to hinder and prejudice further forensic investigations that have been instituted by the board.
