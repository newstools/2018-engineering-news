The decision to shelve plans to build new nuclear power plants was not based on principle but price and reduced electricity demand, Energy Minister Jeff Radebe said on Tuesday. "We have not deliberately left nuclear out but it is not in the plan due to lower demand and lower cost of other technologies," Radebe told Parliament's portfolio committee on energy. He was briefing MPs on the new draft Integrated Resource Plan released last week, which makes no provision for controversial plans by the administration of former President Jacob Zuma to construct additional nuclear plants and add 9.6 gigawatts to the national power grid.
