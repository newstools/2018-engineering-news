The National Home Builders Registration Council (NHBRC) has concluded a disciplinary process for three out of four executives that were suspected of unethical behaviour. The most serious sanction was a dismissal verdict against the corporate services executive. The COO was sanctioned with a final written warning, and a separation agreement was signed with the chief risk officer. The fourth case is ongoing, owing to lack of availability of the individual’s legal counsel. The number of labour disputes that were faced by the NHBRC for the 2017/18 financial year to date is 33. Of these, 13 were handled at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration and 20 were handled internally. During the current financial year, two employees were dismissed – one for alleged corruption and the other for failure to discharge their fiduciary duties. NHBRC CEO Mziwonke Dlabantu on Monday stressed that he will not tolerate any unethical behaviour from anyone in his team. “As an organisation that needs to earn the respect and trust of our stakeholders, the NHBRC occupies a position that demands an impeccable reputation if we are to be perceived as a formidable and ethical regulator. “It gives me little pleasure in having to discipline and sometimes fire individuals who do not share the same values as ours at the NHBRC,” he stated.
