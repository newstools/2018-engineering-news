Official site clearing and preparation for earthworks have started at Ngodwana Energy’s 25 MW biomass power project, in Mpumalanga. The ELB-KCC Consortium on Wednesday said the project will be erected at the Sappi Ngodwana site about 40 km from Nelspruit, next to the N4 highway and is part of the South African government’s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. The ELB-KCC Consortium, which comprises ELB Engineering Services, KC Cottrell (KCC) and the ELB Educational Trust, has been appointed engineering, procurement and construction contractor for the project. ELB will start site clearing, geotechnical drilling, access roads and connection of services such as water, power and sewage. Bulk earthworks will start thereafter, so that piling can start for the power island buildings. KCC has awarded the contract for the boiler and turbine generator and they are busy with the other major packages in the power island. Apart from technical execution, engagement with local community has also started, to discuss the economic development opportunities made available as a result of the project. Korea-based KCC will be providing the power island, comprising a boiler, turbine generator, cooling towers and an air pollution control system, while ELB will be responsible for the civil work, fuel handling, electrical switchyard and site erection.
