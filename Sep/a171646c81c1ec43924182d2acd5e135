South African President Cyril Ramaphosa authorised a new investigation into a water ministry contract with German software firm SAP on Thursday, citing allegations that public money was spent unlawfully. The investigation by South Africa's Special Investigating Unit (SIU) comes after the country's anti-corruption agency said in March it had launched a separate probe into a R671-million water ministry deal with SAP. SAP was not immediately available for comment on Thursday. It has said previously it is conducting a review of its deals with the South African government dating back to 2010 after admitting to wrongdoing in contracts involving the Guptas, friends of former president Jacob Zuma. The South African presidency said in a statement the SIU would look into allegations that SAP's work for the water ministry "had not been fair, competitive, transparent, equitable or cost-effective, and that legislation, guidelines or policies had been flouted". Ramaphosa has pledged to crack down on corruption after a string of scandals under Zuma. Several investigations into government and private companies have moved forward since Ramaphosa replaced Zuma in February. The anti-corruption investigation by South Africa's constitutionally mandated Public Protector, reported by Reuters in March, was launched after the agency received an anonymous letter alleging wrongdoing by SAP and officials in the Department of Water and Sanitation. At around 1100 GMT, SAP shares were up 0.7 percent at 99.88 euros.
