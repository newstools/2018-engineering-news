US-based contractor HDR International has been selected to conduct a feasibility study for a solar energy project in Mozambique. The study will assess the viability of a photovoltaic plant of up to 100 MW, to be developed in increments of 20 MW to 40 MW. The plant will be located at the Nacala International Airport in Nampula and will be Mozambique’s largest when it reaches full scale. A key feature is an energy storage facility with up to 50 MW capacity, which will be located adjacent to the plant. The US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has granted Mozambican company WHN Solar $1.2-million to develop the project. African independent investment bank Fieldstone will assist WHN Solar with the grant funding and will serve as project development and financial adviser. In addition to HDR, various other US firms will assist with the engineering, geotechnical and energy support, while environmental and social work streams will also be undertaken. Mozambican entities include Couto, Graça e Associados, providing legal counsel, and Norconsult Mozambique, which will assist with a grid study. According to USTDA sub-Saharan Africa acting regional director Paul Marin, the agency is pleased to support the project, which it believes will help to diversify Mozambique’s energy generation mix. “At the same time, the project represents business opportunities for US companies in a key sector in Mozambique,” Marin said in a release this week. “We are excited to help the government of Mozambique develop its vision for universal access to electricity using renewable sources,” said HDR international power client development lead Lisa Larson.
