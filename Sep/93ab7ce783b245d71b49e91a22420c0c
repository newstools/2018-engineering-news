The developing Port of Ngqura, owned by Transnet National Ports Authority, celebrated a milestone this week, with the arrival of the first vessel discharging cargo for Osho Cement. Osho Cement is a new cement manufacturer currently under construction in the Coega Special Economic Zone (SEZ), in Port Elizabeth. The Genco Brittany discharged 55 410 t of cement clinker and gypsum in bulk at the multipurpose terminal’s finger jetty, in berth C101. The ship’s own cranes and grabs, with a capacity of about 12 cubic meters each, discharged the cargo, which was then transported by truck to the Osho Cement factory. “The Port of Ngqura is the preferred gateway for our new client as its infrastructure, draught and location is ideal. The multipurpose terminal can accommodate the preferred Supramax and Ultramax vessels, which carry tonnages ranging between 55 000 t and 63 000 t,” port manager Tandi Lebakeng said. Additionally, Lebakeng noted that the port also offers suitable storage space for this type of cargo to ensure a seamless discharge operation. The import volumes are expected to grow steadily over the next five years, she explained, noting that the new client not only brings regular visitors to the port, but that it also means growth for the Eastern Cape and the South African economy. Osho Cement’s construction is expected to be completed this year, with commercial production starting soon thereafter. The company will import its primary raw material, and manufacture and sell its products locally, as well as exporting cement to Indian Ocean Islands and countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
