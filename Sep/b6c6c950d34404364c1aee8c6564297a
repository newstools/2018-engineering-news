Wind turbine manufacturer Nordex Group has been awarded contracts in South Africa to install 80 AW125/3150 turbines for the Garob and Copperton projects, in the Northern Cape. The turbines have a combined capacity of 252 MW. The Garob project comprises 46 turbines, which Enel Green Power has ordered. The Copperton project comprises 34 turbines for developer and independent power producer Elawan. Both projects include delivery and installation, as well as multiyear service contracts. In addition, Nordex will produce the 100 m concrete towers close by, thus lowering the costs and increasing local manufacturing content. These contracts bring Nordexâ€™s total awarded supply for 2018 to 400 MW.
