Petrochemicals company Sasol on Monday said it had activated contingency measures to minimise potential disruption to its operations, in light of trade union Solidarity’s plans to strike. Currently, parts of Sasol’s Secunda and Sasolburg operations are undergoing planned maintenance shutdowns, which continue as scheduled, the petrochemicals company said, adding that planning for these shutdowns is an ongoing yearly process. Operations that are not part of the yearly maintenance shutdown are also continuing as planned. The company continues to monitor the situation and said its priority is ensuring that all personnel are engaged to ensure safe and ongoing operations. The contingency plan came into effect after workers from Solidarity started a go-slow protest at Sasol on Monday over a share scheme offered exclusively to black staff. A full strike will be launched on Thursday. Leading up to the planned full strike on Thursday, Solidarity will be handing over memorandums at several companies as part of a national day of support for the Sasol employees on Wednesday. The trade union has also called on the public to wear blue on this day, and has requested that members of the public do not fill up with petrol at Sasol petrol stations as a symbolic gesture.
