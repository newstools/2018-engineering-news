From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Paper and packaging company Mpact earlier this month hosted media for a tour inside its paper mill recycling facility in Springs, which also happens to be the biggest recycling plant in South Africa. Marleny Arnoldi tells us more. Marleny Arnoldi: The recycling rate in South Africa has exceeded its 70% target, which was set for 2020, already in 2017. About 1.3-million tonnes was recycled out of a possible 1.8-million tonnes of plastic and paper. At a 600 000 t a year production rate of recycled fibre, Mpact MD John Hunt explains the sorting, baling and pulpmaking process at Mpact’s Springs paper mill plant. Mpact MD John Hunt: Marleny Arnoldi: The fibre that Mpact produces is rolled up into sheets called container board, which is then sold and used by clients to make corrugated boxes, such as cereal boxes. Hunt shares more about Mpact’s market with this material. Mpact MD John Hunt: Marleny Arnoldi: Mpact recycles PET plastic bottles and produces milk crates and wheelie bins from high density polyethylene. Although Mpact is more focused on paper, Hunt tells us more about Mpact’s plastic recycling and challenges thereof. Mpact MD John Hunt: Sashnee Moodley: That’s Creamer Media’s Real Economy Report.
