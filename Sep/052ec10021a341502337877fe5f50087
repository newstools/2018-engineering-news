Law firm Hogan Lovells has appointed Nkonzo Hlatshwayo as chairperson of its South African practice as of October 1, as the term of current chairperson Lavery Modise ends. The firm praised Modise for being an inspirational and dedicated leader during his term at the South African practice, which has offices in Cape Town and Johannesburg. Hlatshwayo said he was grateful for Modise’s leadership and looked forward to continuing his work. The firm singled out Hlatshwayo for his in-depth knowledge and understanding of competition law in South Africa and in the Southern African region. Hlatshwayo has previously served as director on the Department of Trade and Industry’s Competition Board and was later the founding head of the Competition Commission’s Merger and Acquisitions division. He was also Deputy Commissioner and served as the chairperson of the Swaziland Competition Commission for more than three years. In the academic field, Hlatshwayo has lectured in law and has published academic articles and co-authored a book on human rights. “It is a great honour and privilege to be chosen to lead such an accomplished group of lawyers and support professionals. Our presence in South Africa and throughout the continent is growing, and playing a critical role in African development. Africa’s future is bright,” said Hlatshwayo.
