FAW South Africa’s Coega assembly plant, in the Eastern Cape, in August celebrated the assembly of the 4 000th FAW truck in South Africa. Inaugurated in July 2014, the FAW plant was the first large-scale investment made by a China-based company in the region. The R600-million plant employs 120 people. The plant has increased production to include almost all FAW commercial vehicles sold in the sub-Saharan region today. It has produced 1 061 vehicles in the past 13 months, averaging 81 vehicles a month, which were either sold locally or exported into Southern Africa. To date, 16 different models have been assembled, ranging from the 8.140 to the 420 hp FAW 33.420FT truck tractor, which is the newest model in the company’s extra-heavy commercial vehicle range and the successor to the FAW 28.380FT. Total FAW exports reached 159 units in 2016, increasing by 212 units in 2017, establishing FAW as the second largest commercial vehicle exporter in South Africa. The brand also set a new sales record in 2017, despite the tough economic environment. Sales grew from 929 units in 2016, to 1 032 units in 2017.
