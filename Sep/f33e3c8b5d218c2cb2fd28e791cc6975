On Wednesday fuel prices will increase by just 4.9c per litre, the Department of Energy announced on Monday. This is below the 23c to 25c per litre increase expected by the AA. In a media statement, the department said that SA had witnessed "sustained increases in fuel prices for the past few months, which placed a strain on the consumers". "Despite the fact that these increases were caused mainly by international factors, the department has decided to intervene temporarily for this month. This is a once off temporary intervention to provide some relief to motorists and consumers against fuel price hikes," the department said in a statement. The 4.9c/l increase will cater for the "annual salary increase for forecourt attendants, cashiers and other administration staff," it said.
