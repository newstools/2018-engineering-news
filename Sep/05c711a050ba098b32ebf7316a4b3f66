The South African National Road Agency Limited (Sanral) has completed repairs to and the resealing of the 61-km-long R510, which runs from Rustenburg, in the North West, to the Limpopo border. “The road is now much more comfortable for drivers and safer for pedestrians. It has brought some considerable economic benefits to emerging contractors and suppliers in the area,” Sanral project manager Nontobeko Mathenjwa said in a statement issued on Wednesday. About R50-million was spent on aiding local small, medium-sized and microenterprises and more than 100 local jobs were created during the road repair and reseal process. The entire project cost R142-million and included upgrading three intersections and a raised pedestrian crossing.
