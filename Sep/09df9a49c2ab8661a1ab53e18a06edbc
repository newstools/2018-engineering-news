Oxford Universityâ€™s African Studies Centre will inaugurate its International Advisory Board (IAB) on October 12, which is set to establish stronger ties with African governments, as well as leaders in business, finance, diplomacy and the arts. Supermarket chain Pick n Pay chairperson Gareth Ackerman will join the nine-member board of the IAB, along with former South African Reserve Bank governor and former Labour Minister Tito Mboweni, who will chair the IAB. Other members of the IAB are Namibian lawyer Monica Geingos, former United Nations political affairs under-secretary Professor Ibrahim Gambari, Zambian economy and social development expert Dr Charlotte Harland-Scott, Nigerian Kaduna state governor Nasir El-Rufai, DLO Energy Group South Africa MD Linda Mabhena-Olagunju, UK policy and practice director Alex Duncan, and Ghanaian economist and author Ivor Agyeman-Duah. IAB members are distinguished individuals who occupy positions of consequence and will help with policy, including potential fellowships and grants, to enable Africans to study at Oxford University. The board will also seek engagement in faculty exchange programmes with public policy experts and specialists in Africa, as the African Studies Centre seeks to build on its already considerable influence.
