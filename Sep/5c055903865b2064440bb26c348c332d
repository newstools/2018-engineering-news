President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Saturday travel to New York where he will lead a South African delegation at the 73rd session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, his office said on Friday. In his first participation at the assembly as head of state, Ramaphosa will take part in an annual general debate as world leaders discuss global issues under the theme: “Making the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies". The Presidency said Ramaphosa would, in his inaugural address to the UN, outline South Africa’s domestic and foreign policy goals and priorities, including its land reform programme aimed at fostering greater stability, inclusiveness and transformation within the economy. "While in New York, President Ramaphosa will meet with CEOs of major global companies as part of the drive to attract foreign direct investment in order to ramp up the South African economy," it said. "This will form part of the build-up to South Africa’s International Investment Conference which will take place on 26 and 27 October with a focus on bringing investment of $100-billion into the South African economy over the next five years." The UN debate will be preceded by the unveiling of a statue of former South African president Nelson Mandela and the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit honouring the global icon who died in 2013 and would have turned 100 years on July 18 this year. "The Nelson Mandela Peace Summit will be an opportunity for heads of state and government to commit global support towards ending conflict in the world and on the African continent in particular, in line with the African Union’s aspirations of 'silencing the guns by 2020'," said the Presidency.
