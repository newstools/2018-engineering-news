Trade union Solidarity and petrochemicals major Sasol were unable to reach an agreement during talks at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) on Wednesday. Solidarity CE Dr Dirk Hermann said the mediation was deferred to get more clarity on the final Mining Charter’s wording. Meanwhile, the protracted strike by Solidarity members employed at Sasol continues. The strike, in its third week, is in opposition to Solidarity members’ exclusion from Sasol’s employee share ownership plan. Hermann noted that the Mining Charter, which is currently before Cabinet, states that all workers, regardless of race, are to participate in employee share ownership plans. Sasol owns coal mines and must comply with the Mining Charter, the union averred. “Through its Khanyisa share ownership plan, Sasol wishes to break the charter agreement reached between the parties. The point of departure for the mining negotiations was that workers are workers and should not be divided on the basis of race. Sasol is doing the opposite and this will increase racial tension and division,” Hermann warned. Sasol, in a statement on Monday, noted that it had agreed to meet with Solidarity at the CCMA.
