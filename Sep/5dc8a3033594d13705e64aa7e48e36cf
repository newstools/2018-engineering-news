The South Gauteng High Court, in Johannesburg, on Friday overturned the National Economic Development and Labour Council’s (Nedlac’s) decision to reject trade union Solidarity’s application for all of its members at all places of work to be permitted to lawfully participate in protest action in solidarity with those of its members who are on strike at petrochemicals multinational Sasol. Solidarity members employed by Sasol have gone on strike in protest against their exclusion from employee share ownership plans. “We are planning a huge protest action to support Sasol members and to protest racial exclusion,” commented Solidarity CE Dr Dirk Hermann. The union has about 140 000 members, according to its Webpage. The date of the strike will be announced as soon as the Nedlac process has been finalised.
