Private locomotive and rail operator Traxtion Sheltam and Austria-based rail services company Railway Material and Resources (RMR) have signed an agreement to create a joint venture (JV) called RMR Africa, that will distribute rail parts across the African continent. The JV brings together two established players in the rail industry. Traxtion has been providing rail services and solutions across Africa for 30 years. Its newly developed Rosslyn facility, where RMR Africa will be based, will soon offer a maintenance and rail services hub for fleets across the continent. RMR is a globally recognised supplier of rail transportation parts, services and project support. “RMR Africa is in a prime position to leverage off of RMR’s international supplier network, experience in the region and understanding of the industry,” said Traxtion CEO James Holley.
