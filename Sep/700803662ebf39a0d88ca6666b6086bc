ELB Engineering Services and Elwatini Rail Consultants have formed a special purpose vehicle (SPV), ELB-Elwatini Rail Solutions, to provide services in rail feasibility studies, railway planning, railway engineering design, construction supervision and management, civil design, traction power and overhead traction equipment design project management. The SPV is also considering adding railway signalling to its offering. Services offered will be marketed to any load carrying rail, including overhead cranes and bulk materials handling stockyard equipment. The SPV allows the railway expertise of Elwatini to be offered to the market on a larger scale, based on ELB’s engineering and project execution ability. ELB is a solutions provider to the mining, power, port, construction and industrial sectors. Elwatini boasts specialists with experience in rail engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, project management and construction management. The company’s skills include track geometric design, permanent way, civil infrastructure, earthworks, overhead traction equipment design, rolling stock requirements analysis and railway planning. Elwatini will now be able to undertake much larger assignments and, together with preferred partners, offer a complete value-adding solution to both companies’ clients. The addition of rail expertise completes ELB’s full offering from run-of-mine tip to ship loading.
