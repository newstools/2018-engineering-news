JSE-listed technology firm Datatec’s Logicalis South Africa subsidiary has acquired Cape Town-based Clarotech. Clarotech offers Internet protocol telephony and call centre cloud and managed services to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the region. The acquisition will enable Logicalis to extend its managed services capability with a mature SMB customer base, strong service delivery and sales capabilities to drive scale and relevancy in the region, Datatec said on Monday. According to Datatec CEO Jens Montanana, the acquisition enables Logicalis to combine a focused managed services operation with its existing business in South Africa, to support SMBs as well as larger corporates. “Clarotech has been providing first rate solutions and services to its clients and will bring a strong capability to our business and provide the opportunity to upsell an increased portfolio of services to our clients, not just in South Africa but also around the globe,” he said.
