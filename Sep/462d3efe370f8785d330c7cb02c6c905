With a rich and knowledgeable skills set, each Rolfes company has consummate industry specialists leading the way forward. “The team will concentrate on the South African market, addressing the agricultural, food, industrial and water chemicals markets,” he noted. While strengthening its operational base across the group, Buttle remarked that Rolfes will maximise and build on current client potential across all companies. “A plan is in place to extend the solution-focused offerings across all industries and continue to develop and grow a strong base of leading suppliers.” He added that further growth will be derived from the group’s intention to extend and grow its regional businesses across South Africa and to expand the commodities product base across multiple product lines.
