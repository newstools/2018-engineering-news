The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) is calling for submissions on the pollution of the Vaal river. This follows after the commission conducted a site inspection of the Vaal river earlier this month, following allegations that about 150 Mâ„“/d of raw sewage was spilling into the river. The site inspection has revealed a prima facie violation of the right of access to clean water, a clean environment and human dignity, the SAHRC said in a statement issued on Monday. In light of this, the commission will hold an inquiry at Stonehaven on the Vaal from September 25 to 27, as part of its investigation into these allegations. Members of the Vaal community and surrounding areas, organisations and interested parties are invited to make written submissions to the commission in order to fully address the issues for investigation. Written submissions must reach the commission by November 30, and can be emailed to zmkhize@sahrc.org.za or tjonas@sahrc.org.za Submissions can also be faxed to 086 4100 149.
